\begin{abstract}
    The \Kepler{} fields have yielded a large data set of photometric rotation
    periods; they serve as a crucial benchmark for studies of stellar rotation
    in field stars. We report on spectroscopic measurements from the APOGEE
    survey of stellar rotation in a sample of over 600 cool dwarfs in the
    \Kepler{} fields. Our data are in good agreement with literature values for
    targets in common, with a detection threshold between 7 and 12 \kms. We
    find a rapid rotation fraction of \(\sim 10\%\), a larger than expected
    population of young stars. When comparing spectroscopic to photometric
    rotation rates, we find that the photometric rapid rotator fraction is
    lower than the spectroscopic fraction by a factor of 4-5. A point-by-point
    analysis reveals that almost all targets have rotation periods too long for
    their measured \vsini{}. We find these results suggest that large-scale
    photometric surveys may mis-characterize or exclude cool rapid rotators in
    the field.

\section{Introduction}

One of the significant results from the \Kepler{} satellite has been the
determination of rotational periods for a large sample of old, field stars
\citep{Basri11,Affer12,Nielsen13,Reinhold13,McQuillan14,Garcia14}.
These rotation rates are expected to be extremely useful to deriving a field
gyrochronology, which can better characterize the ages of
\Kepler{} stars, and hence better understand discovered planets.

The \Kepler{} field was chosen to point outside of the plane of the galactic
disk, biasing the field toward older stars. Despite the old age of the
field, there is still a population of rapid rotators at the level of 1\% of the
population which have rotation rates significantly higher than expected from
existing gyrochronological relations \citep{McQuillan14}. Possible explanation
for these rapid rotators are a truly young stellar population, a background of
tidally-synchronized binaries, contamination of background pulsators in the
\Kepler{} PSF, or confusion with rapidly-rotating subgiants \citep{vanSaders13}. 

While there have been many attempts to evaluate the determination of rotation
periods in \Kepler{} field stars, all have been 
comparisons between different periodograms, but not with independent 
measures of rotation, such as \vsini.  One valuable tool in comparing the two
measures of rotation is a uniform derivation of stellar radii. An initial attempt 
at estimating stellar radii was the original KIC \citep{Brown11}, which fit 
broad-band \textit{griz} and an intermediate-band \textit{D51} filter 
photometry to \citet{Castelli04} stellar atmospheres to derive \Teff{} and
\logg{}, and \citet{Girardi00} isochrones to infer radii based on stellar
models. High-resolution spectroscopy found that radii from the original 
KIC were found to be systematically underestimated \citep{Everett13}. 
Additionally, around 5\% of \Kepler{} targets had original KIC parameters which 
were considered unphysical for an 
old field population \citep{Batalha13}. 

\citet{Huber14}, and the updated methodology in \citet{Mathur17}, attempt to
address the shortcomings in the original stellar parameter classification by
re-adjusting the KIC parameters to conform to more current DSEP isochrones 
\citep{Dotter08}, and also incorporate more precise input stellar parameters 
such as asteroseismology and spectroscopy. The more sophisticated analysis also
fits all stellar parameters simultaneously, which reduces the number of targets
with unlikely or unphysical properties.

In this paper, we study the rotation distribution of \Kepler{} targets as
seen from APOGEE \vsini{}s and compare to published periods. In 
Section~\ref{sec:sample} we describe how we
selected our sample of cool dwarfs to ensure a reliable comparison between
\vsini{} and period. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we describe the reliability
of the quantities we need in order to compare rotation via \vsini{} and
photometric modulation. We also apply our methodology to the APOKASC
asteroseismic sample. In Section~\ref{sec:fraction}, we compare the rapid
rotator fraction from photometric studies to that found using APOGEE spectra.  
In Section~\ref{sec:results}, we compare the two measures of rotation on a
point-by-point basis. Lastly, we summarize and describe
the impact of our findings in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\end{figure}

The central dataset for this analysis is from the Apache Point Observatory 
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) \citep{Blanton17,Majewski17}. The
APOGEE instrument is a high-resolution (\(R \sim 22,000\) multi-fiber 
near-infrared spectrograph \citep{Wilson10}, mounted on the SDSS 2.5-meter 
telescope at Apache Point Observatory \citep{Gunn06}. Observations for each
target are automatically reduced and combined as part of the APOGEE data 
pipeline \citep{Nidever15}. Stellar parameters are then determined from the 
combined spectra through the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundance 
Pipeline (ASPCAP), which determines \Teff{}, \logg{}, \([M/H]\), \vsini{}, as 
well as 15 additional chemical abundances \citep{GarciaPerez16}.

Under several major observing programs, APOGEE systematically observed over 
5,000 dwarfs and subgiants in the \Kepler{} field. Around half were
observed as part of a program to determine false positives for
asteroseismic detections. They were part of a magnitude-limited sample
selected according to 6500 K \(> \Teff > 5000\) K and \(\logg > 3.5\)
according to parameters derived by \citet{Huber14}. An additional 1000
cool dwarfs with (\(\Teff < 5500\) K) and \(\logg > 4.0\) as determined
by \citet{Brown11,Pinsonneault12} were also observed. Eclipsing binaries
and planet host candidates were also observed by APOGEE, but with more
complex selection functions, which we will leave out in this analysis.

We select our sample to minimize ambiguity in the stellar radius when
comparing rotation periods to \vsini. In general, large uncertainties in
determining stellar parameters propogate to the radius estimates. This is 
especially prominent in the hot star regime, where higher-mass subgiants and 
lower-mass dwarfs have \Teff{} and \logg{} values that are easily confused.

In order to sidestep detailed modeling of the complex radius uncertainties 
for all \Kepler{} targets, which will be simplified greatly with upcoming
\Gaia{} parallaxes, we choose instead to study measures of
stellar rotation in the cool  dwarf regime, where
slow stellar evolution maintains a clean separation between dwarf and
subgiants. 

For our base sample, we choose objects observed as part of the APOGEE cool
dwarf ancillary targeting
program\footnote{\url{http://www.sdss.org/dr14/algorithms/ancillary/apogee/kepler_dwarfs/}}.
This program targeted stars observed by \Kepler{} with SDSS-corrected
\(\Teff < 5500\) K \citep{Pinsonneault12}, original KIC \(\logg > 4.0\)
\citep{Brown11}, and 2MASS \(7 < H < 11\). While many of these objects
were observed in the first phase of APOGEE with the
\textit{APOGEE\_KEPLER\_COOLDWARF} targeting flag enabled, much of the rest of
the sample was observed in APOGEE-2 under the \textit{APOGEE2\_SEISMO\_DWARF}
flag. We applied the original selection criteria to the new sample in order get
the updated target list \gvs{Use Jen's original list for this?}. As of the DR14, 
the program has been \(\sim 85\)\% completed with 1028 objects having been 
observed. 

We also selected based on APOGEE stellar parameter fits. We categorized the 
sample into those with \STARBAD, \STARWARN,
\VSINIWARN{}, and no flag enabled to check the quality of the fits. We
visually inspected the spectra for a representative sample of these
quality classes. 
Visual inspection over these targets show that they are largely
the result of poor subtraction or normalization of the spectrum in the
pipeline, or are due to poor model fits on the cool (\(\Teff < 4250\) K) end. 123
targets in the full sample has the \STARBAD{} quality flag enabled. 
However, stars labeled as \STARWARN{} are a significantly larger fraction of the 
sample. We generally find that the model fits look reasonably similar to the 
target spectra. For this reason, we retain targets
with the \STARWARN{} flag enabled. We find that the same occurs for targets with 
the \VSINIWARN{} flags.

Systematic uncertainties in \logg{} permeated the original KIC stellar
classification. Later analyses found many cases of contamination in the dwarf 
sample by subgiants 
and giants \citep{Mann12,Gaidos13}. Because the APOGEE cool dwarf sample was 
selected based on photometry from the original KIC, we expect contamination 
from subgiant and giants. However, APOGEE stellar parameters, 
despite being uncalibrated for dwarfs and suffering from 
systematic uncertainties, are readily able to distinguish between subgiants and 
dwarfs. We illustrate this in the top left panel of \cref{fig:sample}; there is a 
relatively clean separation between the dwarf and subgiant branches. We use the
temperature-dependent \logg{} cut shown in \cref{fig:sample} to select 657
dwarfs. We also use asteroseismic dwarfs, shown in the top right panel of
\cref{fig:sample}, as a well-characterized test sample, to probe the 
dwarf-subgiant separation with APOGEE stellar parameters in
Section~\ref{sec:radii}.

We also inspected the spectra for every target with \(\vsini > 7 \kms\)
for double-lined spectra. Some targets were obvious cases where ASPCAP fit a 
single broad line over two narrow features, other cases only revealed the
second component in individual visit spectra. There are
also cases where the observed spectrum experiences high RV variability
without a visible second component. We include these cases in our sample
because the measured \vsini{} shouldn't be impacted.

When performing the point-by-point analysis of spectroscopic rapid rotators, 
we take the subset of 408 objects
observed in APOGEE which also have period detections in \citet{McQuillan14}.
An additional 205 are period nondetections. To check for biases between the
photometric and spectroscopic sample, we measure the rapid rotator fraction in
both the full and overlap rapid rotation samples.

\subsection{Asteroseismic Targets}

One of the most well-characterized subsets of the \Kepler{} field is the
APOKASC asteroseismic sample. The APOKASC asteroseismic dwarf and subgiant 
sample consists of 426 targets which presented solar-type oscillations in 
\Kepler{} short-cadence data \citep{Chaplin11}, and were observed in APOGEE DR13
\citep{Majewski17}. Using asteroseismic scaling relations, the radii
for these objects can be determined to an accuracy of around 3\%
\citep{Serenelli17}. Because of their excellent parametrization, we treat the
asteroseismic catalog as a control sample, where stellar properties are
well-known. It should be noted that subgiants are overrepresented in
the asteroseismic population because the amplitude of solar-type oscillations 
increases as stars evolve. The locations of the asteroseismic targets in an HR
diagram is shown in the top right panel of \cref{fig:sample}.

From the 426 asteroseismic dwarfs from the APOKASC v4.2.4 catalog, we removed 
three objects with the STAR\_BAD flag. We include 51 objects with 
the \STARWARN{} and 46 objects with the \VSINIWARN{} flags after visual 
inspection because we observed that their modeled stellar parameters tended to
yield visually reliable fits to the spectra.  All targets with \(\vsini \ge
7\) \kms{} were visually
inspected for double-lined spectra. Four were excluded due to the obvious
presence of double-lines. 91 of the remaining stars have period detections in 
\citet{McQuillan14}, 240 were period nondetections, and 88 did not fall under 
the selection criteria in \citet{McQuillan14}. 

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In order to consistently compare different measures of rotation, we require 
reliable \vsini{}, rotational periods, and stellar radii. We perform validation
exercises to make sure that the quantities adopted for these three measures are 
reasonable.


\subsection{\vsini{} validation}
\label{sec:vsini_check}

\vsini{} measurements are relatively new additions to the ASPCAP pipeline, only
being included since DR13. As a result, they have not been extensively vetted and 
verified. We undertake verification for our purposes by comparing \vsini{} 
measured in APOGEE to \vsini{} values for
targets studied with high-resolution optical spectroscopy. 

One large collection of \vsini{}s comes from an effort to study the
\Kepler{} asteroseismic targets \citep{Bruntt12}. \citet{Bruntt12} analyzed 
spectra of 93 solar-type asteroseismic targets using two R=80,000 spectrographs 
on the 3.6-meter Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope and 2-m Bernard Lyot
Telescope. While uncertainties are not quoted in \citet{Bruntt12},
previous analyses have determined \vsini{} uncertainties of about 0.6
\kms \citep{Bruntt10a,Bruntt10b}.

A comparison between the APOGEE and \citet{Bruntt12} targets is shown in
\cref{fig:sample}. Not shown are six
objects which the ASPCAP pipeline classified as giants, and omitted
\vsini{}. The \citet{Bruntt12} \vsini{} is less than 5
\kms{} for all of these objects, again making them consistent with nondetections.
In order to characterize the APOGEE \vsini{}s, we model the two datasets as
being linearly related above a specific detection threshold with a constant
fractional uncertainty. The sample shows a 
discontinuity in the scatter at APOGEE \(\vsini=6\kms\), which we 
interpret as the detection limit of APOGEE, above which \vsini{} yields a valid 
stellar rotation measurement. Since the \citet{Bruntt12} errors are
significantly smaller than the APOGEE errors, we perform a simple linear
regression for all targets with APOGEE \vsini{} above the detection limit to
obtain the relationship. We get that the two datasets are consistent with each
other but with a significant zero-point offset of 9\%. We estimate the
measurement error by calculating the mean squared error of the residuals, which
is 13\%. We adopt this as the uncertainty in the APOGEE \vsini{} values.

There is little overlap between our cool dwarfs and the 
\citet{Bruntt12} sample because the asteroseismic targets tend to be massive and 
highly populated by subgiants. We also check the APOGEE \vsini{}s against
observations of cool dwarfs in the Pleiades \citep{Stauffer87}. Because
Pleiades dwarfs are significantly younger than those in the field,
they rotate much more rapidly. This ends up being advantageous because their 
wide distribution of \vsini{}s allows for a wide range of \vsini{}s to be 
validated. We plot the overlap sample in the bottom right panel of
\cref{fig:sample}.  Unlike the asteroseismic targets, the Pleiades targets seem to experience a
discontinuity in behavior at \(\vsini = 12 \kms\). \gvs{Include other Pleiades
    targets. Check that scatter above is consistent with 10\%}

The difference in detection limit between the Pleiades and asteroseismic sample
indicates that the ability to measure \vsini{} changes is a function of stellar
parameters. In order to ensure that nondetections do not affect our results, we
perform our analyses with different detection thresholds in order to ensure
that the results are robust.

\subsection{Period Validation}

The validation of rotational periods in the \Kepler{} field has been a
well-studied problem. There have been multiple different approaches to
measuring rotation periods \citep{Reinhold13,Nielsen13,McQuillan14,Garcia14}.
Based on the analysis with \citet{McQuillan14}, their periods agree with
previous analyses for \(\sim\)95\% of the overlap sample, with visual 
inspection of the light curve indicating that much of the disagreement was 
caused by aliases detected by previous works. 

A comprehensive, blinded comparison of periodograms analyzed the performance of
several different algorithms on injected stellar rotation signals 
\citep{Aigrain15}. The Autocorrelation Function method used in \citet{McQuillan14} was 
found to have an extremely high detection fraction while still maintaining 
around 70 percent reliability in detecting the injected signal. Given the 
intensive study of different photometric period-detection routines, we refer 
the reader to \citet{Aigrain15} for a detailed discussion about the 
performance of periodograms.

\subsection{Comparison for Asteroseismic Targets}
\label{sec:astero}

\begin{figure}
    \plotone{astero_rot}
    \caption{\emph{Left:} Measured \vsini{} for asteroseismic sample plotted
        against inferred \vsini{} from the period and radius. The solid line 
        denotes the one-to-one relationship. Due to the stellar inclination, most
        of the sample should fall beneath the line. \emph{Middle:} Projected
        radius inferred from \vsini{} and period plotted against the inferred
        radius from isochrones. Inclination should cause most points to lie
        below the line. \emph{Right:} Inferred period from \vsini{} and radius
        plotted against measured period. Inclination should place most points
    above the line.\label{fig:astero_rot}}
\end{figure}

For the asteroseismic targets, we compare the measured \vsini{}, rotational 
period, and radius against inferred values derived from
the other two quantities. The resulting comparison is shown in
\cref{fig:astero_rot}. We distinguish between confident \vsini{} detections
with \(\vsini > 12 \kms\), and marginal detections with \(7 \kms < \vsini < 12
\kms\). Of the confident detections, two  
have non-physical solutions with \(\sin i \le 1\). Only two objects have
unphysical inclinations.

The marginal detections with unphysical \vsini{} (KIC 8677016, 8952800, 10518551) 
have \vsini{} values close to the detection threshold. Because the errors of 
marginal \vsini{} detections are complex, 
it may be possible that these are outliers. 

Of the confident detections with unphysical \vsini{}, KIC 3223000 has a
\vsini{} which is slightly above the predicted equatorial velocity. It
is a 1.7-\(\sigma\) difference based on the \vsini{} uncertainty, which
may be consistent with being a statistical fluctuation. Additionally, it can
be explained by the 4.9 day measured rotation period actually being a 
half-period detection alias, implying that the real equatorial velocity to be twice 
as large. 

The final outlier, KIC 9908400, is so significantly off of the relation
that it can not be explained by either uncertainties or aliasing. However,
it may be adequately explained by contamination of the \Kepler{} PSF\@. UKIRT
high-resolution J-band imaging reveals a bright, nearby blended companion.
Additionally, KIC 9908400 has a high \Teff{} placing it above the Kraft break;
making spots unlikely. Photometric variation originating from the fainter 
star would explain the mismatch in \vsini{} and rotation period.

For the rest of the objects, a more comprehensive upcoming analysis 
(Simonian et al.\ in prep) indicates that not only are the \vsini{} values 
physically plausible, but their distributions are consistent with the
rotational periods within the given uncertainties.

\subsection{Stellar Radii Validation}
\label{sec:radii}

The main property of cool stars we exploit is that their slow age evolution
constrains stellar radii. We quantify this uncertainty using isochrones from the 
Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program (DSEP) to
estimate the impact of age ignorance on the radius uncertainties. We define our
uncertainty as the difference in radius between stars of similar
\Teff{} between 1 and 10 Gyr ages. For solar metallicity models, the uncertainty 
in radius due to age is about 8.5\% at the hot end of
our sample, and decreasing sharply with \Teff. 

We make our error bars for the radius by calculating the stellar radius for
isochrones at the given object's temperature and metallicity at 1 Gyr and 10
Gyr. Because the ``global'' APOGEE uncertainty for [Fe/H] is around 0.05 dex,
to minimize computational resources, we round [Fe/H] to the nearest 0.05 dex.
\gvs{Not true yet. DSEP's interpolation quirks made it so that I could only get
    metallicities to 0.05. I might have to deal with interpolating over
metallicity on my own.}

A significantly larger systematic uncertainty than the impact of age is the 
misclassification of
subgiants as dwarfs. This uncertainty would certainly lead to underestimating
the stellar radii of dwarfs by several factors. We estimate this
contamination rate by using the asteroseismic sample, shown in the top right
panel of \cref{fig:sample}, which mainly consists of subgiants. 

In order to obtain a representative sample of contaminating subgiants, we
select only those with \(\Teff < 5500\) K, resulting in a sample of 317
targets. Of these, all but eight have asteroseismic \logg{} on the subgiant
branch. None have APOGEE \logg{}s which scatter onto the dwarf branch. We do
not concern ourselves with the aswteroseismic dwarfs which APOGEE places on the
subgiant branch because those will not act as contaminants in our dwarf sample. 
Assuming that evolutionary-state classification is a random
process following a binomial distribution, we can infer a 1-\(\sigma\) upper
limit of 2.4 subgiant contaminants in the full cool dwarf sample
\citep{Gehrels86}. 

\section{Rapid Rotator Fractions}
\label{sec:fraction}

The broadest check to determine agreement between the spectroscopic
and photometric rotation data is to calculate the rapid rotator fraction
in both datasets. We define spectroscopic rapid rotators in this exercise as 
stars having \vsini{} above the detection threshold of the APOGEE 
spectrograph. As mentioned in 
Section~\ref{sec:vsini_check}, APOGEE \vsini{} measurements have not been fully
characterized, and the detection limit could reasonably be placed anywhere 
between 7-12 \kms{}. We perform the analysis over multiple detection thresholds
to ensure the robustness of our results.

In order to obtain a corresponding photometric rapid rotator fraction, we need to 
transform the \vsini{} threshold into period space. The relationship between 
rotational period and equatorial velocity is given by the relation
\begin{displaymath}
    v_{eq} = \frac{2 \pi R}{P} 
\end{displaymath}
where \(R\) is the equatorial radius and \(P\) is the rotation period. As we
saw in Section~\ref{sec:radii}, there is a relatively clean and narrow
relationship between radius and \Teff{} on the main sequence. When transforming
between velocity and period-space, we use the DSEP-derived radius for each
individual object, as described in Section~\ref{sec:radii}.

Due to the \(\sin i\) ambiguity, there isn't a simple one-to-one correlation
between a \vsini{} cut and the corresponding period cut given a stellar radius.
Many rapid rotators in period-space should scatter into being non-detections in
velocity space after convolution with the inclination distribution. However,
this distribution can be statistically characterized for randomly
aligned systems. Since our underlying sample was chosen based on
\Teff{} and \logg{}, we don't expect there to be a bias in inclination.
Therefore, we perform a statistical correction of \(\pi/4=0.785\)\footnote{We 
  note that the presence of starspot variability biases the
    inclination distribution against face-on alignments. Measurements
    in clusters indicate that spots are not seen for inclinations where 
    \(\sin i < 1/2\) \citep{Jackson10}, whose exclusion only changes the 
correction factor to 0.740} 
to account for photometric rapid rotators scattering into low
\vsini{}. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{detection_fraction}
    \caption{Rapid rotator fraction as a function of \vsini{} detection limit.
    The solid black line connects spectroscopic rapid rotator fractions for 
    different \vsini{} thresholds. Error bars represent 1-\(\sigma\) binomial 
    confidence levels. The dashed black line marks the fraction of targets 
    with \citet{McQuillan14} periods short enough to be detectable over the 
    given \vsini{} threshold. The photometric rapid rotator fractions are all 
    multiplied by 0.785 to account for inclination effects. Also plotted are
the \citet{McQuillan14} nondetection sample (red), and the rapid rotator
fraction in the subgiants (blue).\label{fig:detection_fraction}}
\end{figure}

We validate this exercise by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic
rapid rotator fractions in the asteroseismic sample. In order to have the best
overlap sample, we use the \vsini{} from \citet{Bruntt12} and rotation period 
from \citet{Garcia14}, whose sample for studying stellar rotation specifically
targeted asteroseismic dwarfs and subgiants. We find that the rapid rotator
fraction as measured spectroscopically and photometrically agree well to within
1-\(\sigma\) at all \vsini{} thresholds. 

The analysis for the cool dwarf sample is shown in 
\cref{fig:detection_fraction}. This time, the \vsini{} measurements
are from APOGEE and the rotation periods are from \citet{McQuillan14}. Error
bars were chosen to be binomial 1-\(\sigma\) confidence intervals based on
selecting the number of rapid rotators from the full sample. Unlike  
the case with the asteroseismic targets, the fraction of spectroscopic rapid
rotators is greater than the fraction of photometric rapid
rotators at a highly-significant level, which is made worse by taking the
inclination correction into account.

We also check the spectroscopic rapid rotator fraction of the 
\citet{McQuillan14} nondetections. We find that the spectroscopic rapid 
rotator fraction is significantly
lower in the nondetections than the overlap sample. The fact that the
non-detection fraction is slower than the detection sample is not
surprising because the former is expected to be comprised of
slow-rotating inactive stars and high-inclination spotted stars, both of
which are expected to yield low \vsini{}. However, the finding that this
sample contains a relatively large numbers of rapid rotators is
significant. This may suggest either the existence of rapidly-rotating,
low-activity targets, or that \citet{McQuillan14} is not detecting rapid
rotation in genuine, spotted rapid rotators.

We also check the rapid rotation sample in the subgiants. We classify subgiants
as those stars observed by the \Kepler{} cool dwarf program with
\logg{} lower than the cut in Section~\ref{sec:sample} to be a dwarf, but 
also less than 3.5. Again, since there
isn't a reliable mapping from velocity to period space for these objects, we
only report the spectroscopi rapid rotator fraction. The subgiants behave
similarly to the cool dwarfs, with a rapid rotator fraction of around 10\%.

Lastly we calculate the rapid rotator fraction for the warmer dwarfs. \gvs{Do I
    want to do this? This seems like it will be analysis better-suited for
another paper}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

        sample.\label{fig:cool_rot}}
\end{figure}

After selecting dwarfs with detectable rotation in APOGEE,
visually inspecting for DLSBs, and cross-matching with \citet{McQuillan14}, we 
end up with 26 targets with confident \vsini{}, and 26 targets with marginal
\vsini{} where we can compare two rotation measures. A point-by-point
comparison for these targets is shown in 
\cref{fig:cool_rot}. Unlike what was observed for the
asteroseismic sample, the measured \vsini{} are consistently larger than the 
given period and radius for all but one star in the sample.

The discrepancy between spectroscopoic and photometric rapid rotation fractions
can be seen in other published work as well. The APOGEE M-dwarf rotation
program \citep{Gilhool18} surveyed a color- and proper-motion-selected sample
of nearby M-dwarfs. Unlike in this work, the \vsini{} were measured directly
through the spectra as opposed to through ASPCAP\@. For the \Teff{} range that
overlaps with \citet{McQuillan14} \(\Teff > 3200\) K, they find that 5.8\% of
their targets have \(\vsini > 8 \kms\). This is significantly greater than our
rapid rotator fraction at 8 \kms of 2.5\%. 

The most obvious systematic error that could cause this problem is
misclassification of subgiants. Subgiant contamination would explain 
results where the measured vsini would be
larger than the inferred equatorial velocity, because the radius is
underestimated. Despite predicting from the asteroseismic sample that
contamination should be low, it may be possible that asteroseismic subgiants
are not representative of the \Kepler{} subgiant population. Even if this
unlikely possibility were true, it would only be able to explain those rapid
rotators with inferred radii up to four solar radii, not all of them.
Contamination from larger red giants would be significantly less likely, and
detection of rapid rotation on red giants would be a significant finding
\citep{Tayar15}.

Confusion in the \Kepler{} pixels is also a potential explanation for the
discrepancy. Because the \Kepler{} pixels are relatively large (4\arcsec), a 
bright, hot primary in the APOGEE fiber with a fainter, spottier companion 
contributing the photometric modulation in the
\Kepler{} light curve would explain the observed contradiction between
\vsini{} and rotation period. While this setup is unlikely, because for stars
cooler than the Kraft break, rotation and activity are highly correlated, 
we check for bright companions
within the \Kepler{} pixel using the public high-resolution UK Infrared Telescope
J-band imaging of the \Kepler{} field. We do not find a correlation between 
that the presence of a bright companion and the magnitude of the offset, 
indicating that confusion is likely not the main source of the problem.

One other potential explanation for the mismatch between the photometric
rotation periods and \vsini{} is the presence of SB2s with a special geometry
where the two components are offset enough that their spectral features
overlap, yet not offset enough for the two components to be visually
distinguished.  To determine the likelihood of this scenario, we check whether
these targets show signs of composite spectra \citep{ElBadry18}. We 
find that 21/23 of the confident detection and 17/23 of the marginal detections
in the overlap sample shows signs of composite spectra based on their
data-driven classification.

One last potential explanation is that the periodograms used in large-scale
analyses are biased against rapid rotators. While it's unlikely there there is
a hard-limit intrinsic to the period-finding algorithms \citep{Aigrain15}, it
may be possible that in the case of real-nonidealized data, with blending of
multiple variability sources, the algorithms tend to favor long periods over
short ones. When we invert the question, and ask how many photometric rapid
rotators are detected as spectroscopic rapid rotators, we find that 7/8 objects
with \(P < 3\) day are spectroscopic rapid rotators. So it appears that the
\citet{McQuillan14} periods are incomplete for the rapid rotators. This is in
agreement with the presence of spectroscopic rapid rotators in the
\citet{McQuillan14} nondetection sample.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We analyzed the APOGEE sample of 400 cool in the \Kepler{} field with 
rotation periods in \citet{McQuillan14} using DSEP-derived stellar radii. We 
find a substantial discrepancy between the two, with the spectroscopic rapid
rotator rate being 4-5 times the photometric rapid rotator rate. 

A point-by-point analysis of the 52 rapid rotators in our sample reveals that
rotational periods for the entire sample are universally too long to match the 
\vsini{}. This finding implies severe systematic uncertainties in either the
measurement of \vsini{}, rotation period, or in stellar classification. We
suggest several possible ways to investigate the underlying causes.

If the discrepancy lies with either concealed binarity or subgiant
misclassification, the upcoming \Gaia{} data release would be able to
test whether this is the case. Parallax-derived radii should be able to
easily distinguish any misclassified subgiants in the APOGEE spectra.
Additionally, binaries where the companion is bright enough to
substantially alter the measured \vsini{} would also be bright enough to
show a significant luminosity excess given the temperature of the star.
Therefore, rapid rotator false positives should appear anomalous in
luminosity compared to main-sequence isochrones.

Systematic uncertainties in period determinations will be significantly more
difficult to investigate. One start may be to perform a targeted period search
at short periods for the rapid rotators where the blind search returned a long
period. The presence of a short-period signal would confirm that the
spectroscopic rapid rotators are physical. Another direction would be to use an
algorithm which can successfully identify multiple periods, as has been used
for the K2 cluster campaign \citep{Rebull16,Rebull17}. If multiple signals are
present in a light curve, these methods may be able to pick both as opposed to
favoring one over the other.

Regardless of the source, we caution readers about interpreting large
datasets of rotation in the \Kepler{} field without independent confirmation
until the source of this inconsistency is found.
