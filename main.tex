\begin{abstract}
    Tens of thousands of rotation periods have been measured in the
    \Kepler{} fields, including a substantial fraction of rapid rotators. We 
    use \Gaia{} parallaxes to distinguish photometric binaries (PBs) from
    single stars on the unevolved lower main sequence, and compare their
    distribution of rotation properties to those of single stars both with and 
    without APOGEE spectroscopic characterization. Virtually all stars 
    with rotation periods between 1--7 days are PBs, and the fraction of stars
    with \(1 \textrm{ day } < P < 7\) day is \(1.9\% \pm 0.1\%\) which
    is also consistent with the population of short period binaries inferred 
    by \Kepler{} eclipsing binary data after correcting for inclination
    (\(1.6\% \pm 0.3\%\)). This suggests that the rapid rotators 
    are dominated by tidally-synchronized binaries rather than single-stars 
    obeying traditional angular momentum evolution. We caution 
    against interpreting rapid rotation in the \Kepler{} field 
    as a signature of youth. Following up this new sample of 199 candidate 
    tidally-synchronized binaries will help further understand 
    tidal processes in stars.

\section{Introduction}

Rotation is a fundamental property of stars; it impacts their lifetimes, can
induce mixing, and can serve as a population diagnostic. Stars are also born 
with a wide range of rotation rates \citep{Attridge92, Herbst00, Henderson12}.
The observed rotation rates are also strikingly different in high and low mass 
stars. \citet{Kraft67} noted a dichotomy in rotation rates: with field stars 
hotter than 6200 K rotating with a wide range of \vsini, and those cooler than 
6200 K, including the Sun, rotating with largely undetectable \vsini. This abrupt transition is thought to
be due to the onset of convective envelopes for lower-mass stars, which 
enables efficient angular momentum loss through magnetized winds 
\citep{Parker58,Weber67}.

The strong dependence of angular momentum loss on rotation \citep{Kawaler88}
leads to the rapid convergence of a wide range of rotation rates to a unique
mass-dependent value; for solar-type stars convergence is nearly complete by
0.5 Gyr \citep{Pinsonneault89}. Rotation is therefore an age indicator for 
stellar populations \citep{Skumanich72}; and correlations between rotation and
age been used to derive empirical relationships for field populations, 
sometimes referred to as gyrochronology \citep{Barnes07, Mamajek08, Meibom09}.  
A full theoretical treatment of gyrochronology requires evolutionary stellar 
models that include a variety of physical effects (see \citet{Gallet13} for an
overview). Models of angular momentum evolution have usually been calibrated 
using rotation periods in star clusters, which have known ages and are easily 
characterized \citep{Krishnamurthi97, Gallet13, Somers17}. The calibrating 
clusters are typically young (\(< 1\) Gyr), with the behavior at old ages anchored by the Sun. 

The \Kepler{} satellite \citep{Borucki10,Koch10}, which observed a single field
for over four years, has revolutionized our ability to measure stellar 
rotation in old field populations. Large-scale analyses have extracted 
rotation periods from the light curves of tens of thousands of field stars
\citep{Nielsen13, Reinhold13, Garcia14, McQuillan14}. These rotation periods, 
along with a field gyrochronology, are expected to provide insights on the age 
distribution of the field, and thus provide more accurate representation of 
transiting exoplanets.

The new observations of old field stars enabled by \Kepler{} have challenged 
our theories of angular momentum evolution on multiple fronts. Existing 
gyrochronological models anchored at the Sun have not been able to explain
the relatively rapid rotation of old field stars with ages inferred from
asteroseismic data \citep{Angus15, VanSaders16}. The \Kepler{} population at 
long periods shows a sharp drop-off which is not predicted by stellar models 
\citep{VanSaders18}.  Nearby K- and M-dwarfs show a bimodality in the period 
distribution which has no clear explanation in stellar physics 
\citep{Davenport18}. There is also a modest, but real, population of rapid 
rotators that would be interpreted as young if they were single main sequence 
stars.

The \Kepler{} field also contains a mixture of stellar populations, not all of 
which have been calibrated in clusters. Subgiants, while being rare in the 
clusters used to calibrate gyrochronology, 
make up 20\% of \Kepler{} targets \citep{Berger18b}. Since the 
subgiant population contains stars expanding off the main sequence from 
above the Kraft break, they obey a different gyrochronology relation than that 
calibrated for cluster dwarfs \citep{vanSaders13}. 

Another population which is not included in traditional angular momentum
evolution models is tidally-synchronized binaries. These binaries have orbital 
periods short enough that tidal interactions force the rotational period to
synchronize to the orbital period. Existing models of tidal theory 
\citep{Zahn77} predict a strong dependence of the synchronization timescale 
on period, leading to rapid transition between
synchronized and unsynchronized systems. Understanding the 
age distribution of the \Kepler{} field at the young end will require 
characterizing the background population of tidally-synchronized binaries.

Tidally-synchronized binaries themselves are in the center of interesting
dynamical phenomena. These systems are thought to be dynamically-formed 
through three-body interactions \citep{Tokovinin06, Fabrycky07}. Once formed, they can experience significant
evolution in orbital period due to angular momentum loss \citep{Andronov06}.
Depending on the rate of angular momentum loss, they can merge to form blue 
stragglers or pre-CV systems.

Tidally-synchronized binaries have been difficult to study because they are 
intrinsically rare and usually require significant spectroscopic resources 
to discover and characterize \citep{Mathieu90, Raghavan10, Geller15}. A review 
of the observational state of tidal interactions is given in \citet{Mazeh08}. 
Most observations efforts to understand stellar tides have focused on 
measuring the ``cut-off period'' for orbital circularization \citep{Mayor84},
which usually requires intense spectroscopic monitoring to derive orbits.
Recent observations using the \Kepler{} field eclipsing binaries place the 
circularization period at around 5 days for stars with convective envelopes 
\citep{VanEylen16}. However, the \Kepler{} rotation dataset will produce the
first large, unbiased sample to study synchronization as opposed to
circularization. 

The availability of \Gaia{} DR2 parallaxes \citep{Gaia18,Lindegren18} has
enabled us to better characterize sources of rapid rotation beyond what is
achievable through photometry and spectroscopy. Young single stars would be
observed as rapid rotators within the field main sequence. Subgiants would lie 
in the Hertzprung Gap, on the way to the Red Giant Branch. Lastly, binaries 
should be up to twice as luminous as the main sequence, extending up to 0.75 
mag above the single-star sequence.  While these populations overlap for hot 
stars, the subgiants and binaries separate cleanly on the lower main sequence.

An additional constraint on the populations comes from the substantial sample
of spectroscopically-characterized dwarfs from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) \citep{Majewski17}. APOGEE contains a 
total of 15,724 objects in the \Kepler{} field with usable stellar parameters,
K-band photometry, and parallaxes.  This sample will be valuable for 
understanding the importance of metallicity to identify populations of 
binaries.

This paper will attempt to compare binarity between the rapid and slow rotators 
in \citet{McQuillan14}. In Section~\ref{sec:data}, we will describe our 
sample, as well as the data used to select binaries. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we demonstrate the regime where 
binaries can be successfully distinguished from single stars with both the 
presence and absence of metallicity information. We'll also characterize the 
uncertainty in our measurements. Section~\ref{sec:results} illustrates our 
results regarding the prominence of binaries among the rapid rotators. Lastly, 
we discuss the implications of our results for the population of rapid rotators 
and lay out future avenues to explore.

\section{Catalog Data}
\label{sec:data}

The base sample of this study consists of \Kepler{} dwarfs that were analyzed
for photometric starspot modulations. All targets in the \Kepler{} field have 
stellar parameters determined at the very least by KIC photometry 
\citep{Brown11}. The total number of objects that were analyzed was 133,030, 
34,030 period detections.

We also examine a spectroscopically-characterized subsample from APOGEE\@. 
This sample has spectroscopically-determined temperatures and metallicities. 
The overlap between this sample and the number of objects inspected by 
\citet{McQuillan14} for rotational period modulation is 3,023.

To calculate vertical displacements above the main sequence, we use photometry
from 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie06}, parallaxes from Gaia DR2 \citep{Gaia18},
\Teff{} from \citet{Pinsonneault12}, extinction values estimated from the 
\Kepler{} Stellar Parameter Catalog (KSPC) DR25 \citep{Huber14,Mathur17}, and
MIST isochrones \citep{Choi16} (described further in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}). For the spectroscopic sample, \Teff{} and [Fe/H] 
are taken from APOGEE DR14 \citep{Abolfathi18}. More detail on these catalogs 
is given below.

\subsection{Default Stellar Parameters}

Stellar parameters for the full \Kepler{} sample are available as part of the
\Kepler{} Stellar Parameter Catalog (KSPC) DR25 \citep{Mathur17}. The KSPC
compiles stellar parameters from the literature and simultaneously fits them
using DSEP stellar evolutionary tracks \citep{Dotter08} via the methodology of
\citet{Huber14}. Revised stellar parameters, such as \Teff, as well as inferred
quantities, such as extinction, are output along with asymmetric
1-\(\sigma\) uncertainties. 

The sophisticated machinery of the KSPC imprints artifacts in the \Teff{}
distribution of cool dwarfs by attempting to stich together the temperature
scales of \citet{Pinsonneault12} and \citet{Dressing13}. Instead of using
\Teff{} from the KSPC, we therefore opted to use temperatures from 
\citet{Pinsonneault12} to ensure uniformly analyzed temperatures; this data is
close to the KSPC scale globally \citep{Huber17}. We note that 
\citet{Pinsonneault12} only provides temperatures for colors where the
infrared-flux method has been well-studied, which corresponds to between
4000--7500 K.

For this paper, we also make use of extinctions from the KSPC\@. The
extinctions are inferred from the predicted absolute magnitude given KSPC 
parameters, and a 3D extinction map \citep{Amores05}. The catalog extinction 
is given as \(A_V\), which we convert to other bands using the 
\citep{Cardelli89} extinction law. 

\subsection{Astrometric Data}

The ability to distinguish between different evolutionary states of stars is
enabled by parallaxes derived from the \Gaia{} mission's Data Release 2
\citep{Gaia18}. The \Gaia{} DR2 performed a fully consistent single-star
5-parameter (\(\alpha\), \(\delta\), \(\mu_\alpha\), \(\mu_\delta\), \(\pi\))
solution to 1.3 billion sources over 22 months of observations
\citep{Lindegren18}. For targets which could not be adequately fit with a
single-star 5-parameter solution, a 2-parameter (\(\alpha\), \(\delta\))
solution is performed instead \citep{Michalik15}. The criteria for a
2-parameter fall-back solution include targets with Gaia \(G > 21.0\), having
fewer than 6 visibility periods of observations, and an error ellipse larger
than a magnitude-dependent limit in its largest dimension \citep{Lindegren18}.

% APOGEE Targeted sample APOKASC (APOKASC + Cool Dwarf - faint dwarfs) - 7642
% Not bad APOGEE targeted sample - 7395
% Good APOGEE with good K detection - 7373
% Good APOGEE in Gaia - 6961

We use the cross-matched database of \citet{Berger18b} to match \Kepler{} targets
against \Gaia{} DR2 detections.
\citet{Berger18b} cross-matched targets in the KSPC DR25 \citep{Mathur17}, 
with \Gaia{} DR2 sources using both position and G-band flux. Of the 
successfully cross-matched targets, \citet{Berger18b} excluded objects with 
fractional parallax errors greater than 0.2, \(\Teff < 3000\) K, 
\(\logg < 0.1\), and low quality 2MASS photometry.  Because all of our 
targets have high-quality parallaxes, we use the traditional 
formula for deriving distance modulus from parallax instead of the Bayesian 
method advocated by \citet{Luri18} to reduce computational complexity. We
include the zero-point offset of 0.05 mas \citep{Zinn18}.
% Include when this calculation is actually *DONE*.
%We converted parallax to distance modulus by using an
%exponentially-decreasing volume density prior with a 1.35 kpc length scale
%\citep{BailerJones15,Astraatmadja16}, and correcting for the zero-point offset
%of 0.5 mas \citep{Zinn18}. \gvs{Should we include a table of this?} 

\subsection{Photometric Data}

In order to characterize our stellar sample, we chose to use absolute K-band
magnitude as a proxy for luminosity to minimize the impact of extinction. 
K-band apparent magnitudes were measured by the 2MASS survey 
\citep{Skrutskie06}, which has profile-fit photometry with uncertainties 
available for nearly the full sample.  The 
typical K-band photometric uncertainty for the \citet{McQuillan14} sample is 
0.03 mag. The typical extinction from the KSPC and its uncertainty for cool 
dwarfs is \(A_V = 0.33\), and \(\sigma_{A_V}=0.025\). Applying the 
\citet{Cardelli89} relation that \(A_K/A_V = 0.114\), the effect of extinction 
itself shrinks to the level of photometric errors.  A small fraction of 
targets (1.5\%) of the \citet{McQuillan14} sample have 2MASS photometry 
flagged due to blending. To avoid contaminating the binary sequence with 
unrelated blends, we exclude these targets.

\subsection{Rotation Data}

The rotation periods for our sample come from \citet{McQuillan14}, which
is large and homogenously measured. \citet{McQuillan14} selected their sample 
to have photometric \(\Teff < 6500\) K \citep{Brown11,Dressing13}, and 
implemented the color-color and \logg{} cuts advocated in \citet{Ciardi11}, 
ranging from \(\logg = 3.5\) at 6000 K to \(\logg = 4.0\) at 4250 K. 
In addition to the temperature and gravity cuts, \citet{McQuillan14} also 
excluded known \Kepler{} eclipsing binaries and \Kepler Objects of Interest. 

Rotational periods in \citet{McQuillan14} were measured by calculating the 
autocorrelation function and fitting the location of multiple peaks. In lieu 
of visual verification of the autocorrelation function, \citet{McQuillan14}
performed two automated tests to distinguish physical periodicity from
instrumental artifacts or other sources of variability. First, the 
periodicity must be consistent in different segments of the light curve.
Secondly, the height of the first peak must be larger than a temperature- and
period-dependent threshold. In order to reduce contamination from pulsators, 
\citet{McQuillan14} only considered periods between 0.2--70 days.

        temperature and 0.02 mag in K-band absolute magnitude. A

    diagram.}\label{fig:mcquillan_selection}
\end{figure*}

The \citet{McQuillan14} sample is shown in a \Teff-\(M_K\)
diagram in \cref{fig:mcquillan_selection}. One of the new results enabled by 
\Gaia{} is that a binary sequence,
located above the main sequence, is clearly seen. Period detections become
relatively rare in evolved stars. The bulk of the period sample are solar
analogs, reflecting the underlying \Kepler{} sample.

\subsection{Spectroscopic Parameters}

We draw our spectroscopic sample from the Data Release 14 \citep{Abolfathi18}
of the APOGEE survey \citep{Majewski17}. The workhorse behind the survey is the
APOGEE spectrograph, a high-resolution (\(R \sim 22,000\)) multi-fiber
near-infrared spectrograph \citep{Wilson10} mounted on the SDSS 2.5-meter
telescope at Apache Point Observatory \citep{Gunn06}.

Reduction of the APOGEE data takes place in three main stages. First,
individual visit spectra are reduced, including detector calibration, bad pixel
masking, wavelength calibration, sky substraction, and determination of
individual radial velocities through cross-correlation of template spectra.
Second, the individual spectra are combined by correcting for radial velocity
differences between the exposures, either by cross-correlating with each other,
or with template spectra, whichever leads to a smaller scatter
\citep{Holtzman18}. The full process is detailed in \citet{Nidever15}.

The final step is the extraction of stellar parameters and chemical abundances
by the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP)
\citep{GarciaPerez16}. ASPCAP measures stellar parameters by performing a
chi-squared minimization \citep{AllendePrieto06} over a 6-dimensional space of
\Teff, \logg, [M/H], [\(\alpha\)/M], \vsini, and microturbulent velocity.

After determination of the stellar parameters, the effective temperatures are 
calibrated to the photometric system of \citet{GonzalezHernandez09} using a 
metallicity-dependent offset. After calibration, the scatter between the 
calibrated and photometric temperatures  were found to be a function of 
\Teff{}, ranging from 130 K at 5500 K down to 85 K at 4000 K
\citep{Holtzman18}.

We inspected the fits to a set of spectra representative of targets flagged 
by the ASPCAP pipeline as having potential quality problems. A small fraction
(2.5\%) of targets have the \STARBAD{} quality flag enabled. Visual inspection
of a representative sample of spectra indicated that the flag was largely the
result of poor subtraction or normalization of the spectrum in the pipeline, or
due to poor model fits on the cool (\(\Teff < 4250 K\)) end. We exclude these
from our analysis. A substantially larger fraction of targets (14\%) have the 
\STARWARN{} quality flag enabled. Visual inspection of a representative sample 
of these spectra indicated that the fits reasonably resembled the underlying 
spectra. We included all targets with the \STARWARN{} quality flag enabled.

\end{figure*}

\Cref{fig:apogee_selection} shows all \Kepler{} targets with observed
spectroscopic temperatures in the APOGEE DR14, color-coded by observing
program. One of the driving efforts for \Kepler{} field observations has been
the spectroscopic characterization of asteroseismic targets, shown as small
black dots \citep{Zasowski17,Pinsonneault18}; 14,162 targets are part of that
sample. The asteroseismic sample is substantially biased toward giants 
and subgiants due to their high amplitude oscillations. A complementary 
program proposed to observe the remaining portion of the \Kepler{} sample 
cooler than 5500 K and brighter than \(H < 11\), make up an additional 765 
targets, shown as small red dots. An additional 695 targets were part of an 
effort to characterize \Kepler{} planet hosts with \(H < 14\), shown as purple 
diamonds. The remaining 102 targets were follow-up of eclipsing binaries 
\citep{Prsa11,Slawson11}, and are shown as light blue circles.  

\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

The fundamental classification in this analysis is to distinguish photometric
binaries from the rest of the sample. The crucial quantity to make this
distinction is the 
vertical displacement above the single-star sequence. Vertical 
displacement is a standard measure of binarity in clusters 
\citep{Mermilliod92}, where the single-star sequence can be described by a
single-age stellar population with a single metallicity. Equal-mass binaries
would lie 0.75 mag above the single-star sequence, while equal-mass triples would be
1.25 mag above. Measuring the vertical displacement for a field population is 
more challenging, because the
field samples heterogeneous ages and metallicities. There is a
field turn-off, however, and for sufficiently cool dwarfs there is a
well-defined unevolved main sequence that is an analog of the cluster case. We
therefore search for the temperature domain where age effects are minimized, 
and the natural width of the unevolved main sequence can be confidently
measured to identify field binaries.

The vertical displacement is a difference of two quantities: the measured 
K-band luminosity of a star, and the inferred K-band luminosity of a single 
star with the same temperature and metallicity as the original one at a reference age. The 
former is a well-constrained and easily calculated quantity given the 2MASS 
photometry and the \Gaia{} parallax; the latter requires a single-star model.

We use the MIST \citep{Dotter16,Choi16} isochrones to model the 
single-star lower main sequence. Bolometric corrections translating from
evolutionary tracks to photometric bands are generated from ATLAS12/SYNTHE
stellar atmosphere models \citep{Kurucz70,Kurucz93}. For a full description of the MIST isochrones, we 
refer the reader to the source papers, as well as the MESA instrument papers 
\citep{Paxton11, Paxton13, Paxton15}, which is the stellar model on which the 
isochrones are based. In order to characterize the vertical displacement, we select 1 Gyr isochrones
as a baseline case. As age effects in the domain of interest are by definition
small, the precise choice of age does not significantly impact our results (see
below).

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{sample_dk}
    \caption{Temperature and K luminosity excess above a 1 Gyr MIST isochrone 
        matched to the APOGEE metallicity for the APOGEE-\Kepler{} sample. 
        In order to exclude evolved stars while preserving binaries and
        triples, we define the dwarf sample as targets less than 1.3 magnitudes
        more luminous than the metallicity-adjusted MIST isochrone (shown as
        violet points). A representative error bar for the 
        full APOGEE dwarf sample assuming Gaussian uncertainties is shown in 
        the lower right corner.}\label{fig:sample_dk}
\end{figure}


The vertical displacement of the full APOGEE sample above a 1 Gyr isochrone is 
shown in \cref{fig:sample_dk}. For every star, the displacement is calculated 
by subtracting the luminosity of the 1 Gyr isochrone with the APOGEE-measured 
metallicity. F and G stars spread above the isochrone, which is 
expected because these stars evolve substantially over the age of the Milky
Way. With the main sequence detrended a visible binary sequence emerges at 
\(\sim0.75\) mag above the main sequence. In order to exclude red 
giant branch stars, we draw a limit at 1.3 magnitudes above the main sequence. 
This limit cleanly excludes red giant branch stars while providing generous 
inclusion limits for binaries and potential triple systems.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{ages}
    \caption{Age-imposed behavior for the APOGEE dwarf sample. The purple
        line denotes the predicted luminosity excess of a 9 Gyr solar
        composition isochrone. The dashed line represents the limit for 
        photometric binaries. The 25th percentile of the dwarfs in 15 
        temperature bins is shown in green. We draw a temperature threshold 
        for the unevolved lower main sequence at 5250 K. A representative 
        error bar assuming Gaussian uncertainties is shown in the lower right
    corner.}
    \label{fig:ages}
\end{figure}

For hot stars, the increase in luminosity due to age is degenerate with
increased luminosity due to a binary companion. To reduce the impact of age,
we restrict ourselves to the unevolved lower main sequence, where age
effects are small. We quantify the impact of age by predicting the vertical
displacement of a 9 Gyr solar-composition MIST isochrone with respect to our 
1 Gyr solar-composition MIST isochrone, shown in \cref{fig:ages}. The
predicted displacement between the two isochrones is -0.20 mag at 5500 K, 
-0.11 mag at 5250 K, and -0.08 mag at 5000 K.

We parametrize the behavior of the main sequence by splitting it into bins
and calculating the 25th percentile of the luminosity excess in each bin. Each 
temperature bin contains a population of both binaries and single stars, with 
binaries having substantially higher vertical displacements. The 25th 
percentile statistic characterizes the main sequence in a way that is robust 
to the population of binaries, and has been used successfully in clusters 
\citep{An06}. Even large departures this assumed binary fraction should 
generally only affect the zero-point, but not the shape of the main sequence.

The main sequence is generally flat at temperatures cooler than 5000 K with
age effects becoming more important at hotter temperatures. The number of stars
also increases substantially with temperature above 5000 K. As a compromise
between age effects and statistical power, we adopt a threshold \Teff{} of 
5250 K to denote the lower main sequence.

\subsection{Corrections for the Spectroscopic Sample}

There are modest, but real, differences between the theoretically predicted
positions of isochrones and the data which impose scatter on the main sequence. 
Trends are not surprising because the NIR behavior of MIST isochrones have not 
been comprehensively tested at a wide range of metallicities \citep{Choi16}. 
In order to achieve a truly flat main sequence, we include both 
metallicity and temperature-dependent terms.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption{\emph{Top:} Residual metallicity trends in the MIST

\end{figure}

We find and correct for a residual quadratic trend in the vertical 
displacement of the main sequence over metallicity, shown in 
\cref{fig:met_trend}.  We fit the trend to 5 equally populated bins. We denote 
the temperature of the bin as the mean temperature of all stars in that bin, 
and the vertical displacement as the 25th percentile of all stars in that bin. 
For the purpose of selecting the optimal binning style, we quantified the 
goodness-of-fit using the median absolute deviation of the top 50th percentile 
of the vertical displacements. The correction was mostly robust to the choice 
of binning; only the sparsely populated low-metallicity regime 
(\([Fe/H] < -0.6\)) was sensitive to the details of binning. Because there are 
only three objects in this metallicity range, our conclusions are not 
sensitive to their treatment.

        \emph{Bottom:} The residuals after subtracting the linear 
    trend.}\label{fig:apogee_teff_trend}
\end{figure}

After correcting the trend in metallicity, we correct a residual trend in
\Teff{}, shown in \cref{fig:apogee_teff_trend} using a similar procedure. This 
trend is slight and can be characterized using a linear fit, using the same 
bins as in metallicity space. After performing these two corrections, we 
consider the main sequence to be flattened to its measured natural width, as
seen in the bottom panel of \cref{fig:apogee_teff_trend}. The persistence of 
the binary sequence in the residuals indicates that our corrections are 
meaningful.  

\subsection{Corrections for Photometric Sample}

The photometric sample in \citet{McQuillan14} differs from the spectroscopic
sample in two main ways: the lack of metallicity diagnostics, and the necessity
of using photometric instead of spectroscopic \Teff{}. Both of these
differences will increase the uncertainty of the inferred single-star K-band
luminosity, and we measure their impact in the following analysis.

For the full \citet{McQuillan14} sample, where individual metallicities are not
available, we need to select an isochrone with a metallicity that is 
representative of the full sample. We do this by assuming that metallicity 
distribution of the spectroscopic targets is representative of the full 
\Kepler{} field. 

\begin{figure*}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{metallicity}
    \caption{\emph{Left:} Metallicity distribution of the \Kepler{} cool 
        dwarfs, selected as having \(\Teff < 5250 \textrm{ K }\) and having

        thick black line denotes the median while the thin black lines denote 
        the \(1\sigma\) confidence intervals. \emph{Right:} The vertical

predicted by the MIST isochrones. The red line denotes the vertical 
displacement caused by metallicity mismatches after correcting for the 
metallicity-dependent offset of the main sequence relative to the MIST 
isochrones shown in \cref{fig:met_trend}.}\label{fig:metallicity}
\end{figure*}

Because we will mostly be concerned with the cool dwarfs, we check the
metallicity distribution of dwarfs cooler than 5250 K, which is the 
temperature range of our sample. The metallicity distribution for that
sample is shown in \cref{fig:metallicity}. The median metallicity is 
0.08, consistent with that observed for planet hosts by 
the California \Kepler{} survey \citep{Petigura17}.  We therefore treat the \([Fe/H] =
0.08\) isochrone as the base isochrone for the photometric sample.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{Teff_relation}
    \caption{Comparison between the APOGEE spectroscopic \Teff{} and the
        \citet{Pinsonneault12} \Teff{} for objects with \(4000 \textrm{ K } \le

two datasets is 135 K. A representative error for both datasets is shown in the
bottom-right corner.}\label{fig:teffdiff}
\end{figure}

We also estimate the impact of the photometric temperatures by directly 
comparing the spectroscopic and photometric temperatures for the set of 
overlapping points shown in \cref{fig:teffdiff}. Overall, the two temperature scales are reasonably
correlated. There is a temperature scatter of 135 K between the two scales.
Taking into account the 100 K uncertainty in the APOGEE \Teff{} scale, this
implies a 90K uncertainty in the \citet{Pinsonneault12} temperatures, which
agrees with the uncertainties expected from the photometric method. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{phot_teff_correction}
    \caption{Same as \cref{fig:apogee_teff_trend}, except subtracting off a
    constant [Fe/H]=0.08 isochrone for all objects instead of a 
    metallicity-adjusted isochrone.}\label{fig:photuncor}
\end{figure}

Combining the two changes: subtracting only a single-metallicity isochrone and
using the photometric temperatures yields the points in \cref{fig:photuncor}.
This sample still has a trend with temperature, that we remove using a linear
fit, similar to that done for the spectroscopic sample.

        panel). Conservative and inclusive binary cuts at \(\Delta K < -0.3\)
        mag and \(\Delta K < -0.2\) mag are shown as violet and green dashed

        best-fit dispersion of the single-star Gaussian is 0.113 
    mag.}\label{fig:histcompare}
\end{figure*}

Now that we have corrected vertical displacements over the 4000--5250 K
temperature range, we can now compare the main-sequence scatter for the two
datasets. We do this by generating histograms for the spectroscopic and
photometric samples over vertical displacement, shown in
\cref{fig:histcompare}. We try to characterize the width of the two samples by
fitting a double Gaussian to each histogram, and taking the width of the
main-sequence Gaussian as the uncertainty in the vertical displacement in the
vertical displacement. Our fits indicate that the scatter for the spectroscopic
sample is 0.085 mag while the scatter for the photometric sample is 0.113 mag.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{ms_width}
    \caption{\emph{Left:} Distribution of vertical displacements for a
        simulated 50\% binary 1Gyr MIST population by subtracting a median 
        metallicity isochrone. The temperature uncertainties are assumed to be

        with a dispersion of 0.15 dex. The single star population is shown 
        with a blue histogram while the binary population is stacked on top in 
    yellow. \emph{Right:} The same plot as on the left, except the intrinsic
K-band luminosity is adjusted by the empirical metallicity-dependent correction

\end{figure*}

This modest increase in the scatter for the photometric sample is surprising,
especially given the strong dependence of K-band magnitude on metallicity shown
in \cref{fig:metallicity} predicted by the MIST isochrones. We believe that the
reduced scatter is real, and that the MIST bolometric corrections overestimate 
the dependence of K-band luminosity on metallicity. We demonstrate that the
metallicity dependence of the isochrones are overestimated by artifically
generating a population representative of the cool \Kepler{} dwarfs, and
comparing the main sequence width of the raw isochrones to the main sequence
width from isochrones flattened by the metallicity correction
in \cref{fig:met_trend}. The population is generated from 1 Gyr MIST 
isochrones with \Teff{} distributed uniformly between 4000-5000 K, and
metallicity distributed normally about solar with a dispersion of 0.15 dex. We
assume a 50\% binary fraction, with the binaries following a flat mass-ratio
distribution. We simulate our vertical displacements by adding a temperature 
error with a width of 90 K and then subtracting a solar-metallicity MIST
isochrone with the transformed temperature. The resulting distribution of
vertical displacements is shown in the left panel of \cref{fig:mswidth}. The
true width of the single-star sequence directly from the MIST isochrones is 
0.161 while the measured width is 0.127. In the right panel, the 
metallicity-dependent correction shown in \cref{fig:met_trend} is added to 
the MIST isochrones to flatten the main sequence in metallicity space. With 
the correction applied, the true width of the single star sequence shrinks to 
0.097 while the measured width shrinks to 0.127. The corrected behavior of 
the vertical displacement with metallicity is shown in the right panel of 
\cref{fig:metallicity} as a red line. Because the observed scatter in K-band
luminosity more resembles the right-hand panel in \cref{fig:mswidth} than the
left-hand panel, we believe that the K-band bolometric corrections impose 
unphysical metallicity trends for lower main sequence stars.

Applying the double-Gaussian fit to the artificial population also implies 
that our method of fitting double Gaussians to the vertical displacement 
distribution underestimates the true single-star scatter by a factor of 1.3. 
In light of this result, we inflate the uncertainties derived from the
double-Gaussian fits by a factor of 1.3 to take into account our imperfect
statistic.




\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

After successfully calculating the vertical displacement of the full sample, we
now attempt to delineate between single and binary stars. As noted in the
previous section, the 1-\(\sigma\) uncertainties of the single-star sequence were 0.09 mag with 
known metallicity, and 0.11 mag when metallicity was unknown, or 0.11 and 0.15
mag after adjusting for the scatter. As a result, we use two
different thresholds to distinguish between binaries and single stars: a more
inclusive 2-\(\sigma\) threshold at -0.26 mag, as well as a more
conservative threshold at -0.39 mag. To prevent age effects from 
biasing the results, we only performed statistics in the 4000--5250 K 
range.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
    \centering
    \epsscale{1.2}
    \plotone{apogee_rapid_excess}
    \caption{\emph{Top Left to Bottom Right:} Vertical displacement of cool 
        APOGEE targets with \citet{McQuillan14} periods \(> 13\) days, between 
        \(5--13\) days, \(1--5\) days, and less than 1 day. Pink stars denote 
        eclipsing binaries with orbital periods within the same ranges. The 
        green and purple lines denote the inclusive and conservative 
        photometric binary thresholds, 
    respectively.}\label{fig:apogee_rapid_excess}
\end{figure*}

For both binarity thresholds, the well-characterized APOGEE sample 
illustrates the differences in binarity between slow and rapid rotators. The
vertical displacements in different period bins are shown in
\cref{fig:apogee_rapid_excess}. All of the rapid rotators with periods between
1--5 days are photometric binaries, in contrast to the slow rotators
with periods greater than 13 days, which have a distinct single star sequence. 
Angular momentum loss due to stellar winds acting over a billion years is
expected to deplete the short-period regime of single stars. The transitional 
periods between 5--13 days have a binary fraction intermediate to the 
rapid and slow regimes. The bin with periods shorter than 1 day is not expected
to behave like detached binaries due to contamination from contact binaries,
ellipsoidal variables and blended pulsators. 

To quantify the significance the excess binary fraction in the rapid rotators, 
we compare the photometric binary fraction of the short-period bin to the
binary fraction of the full sample. In order to accurately characterize the 
binarity of short-period systems, we include the \Kepler{} eclipsing binaries, 
which were excluded by \citet{McQuillan14} to avoid contaminating signal from 
the eclipses. The shortest-period systems are expected to be synchronized, so
we assume that the rotational period is identical to the orbital period. 
The eclipse probability for these short-period binaries can be as high as 40\% 
\citep{Kirk16}, hence ignoring this population would severely
bias the underlying sample. For systems where the orbital period is too long
for synchronization, this assumption would break down and the orbital period
distribution would behave differently from the rotational period distribution.
We will perform a check for this effect further below.

We find that the binary fraction for the full APOGEE sample with temperatures
between 4000--5000 K is 41\%,  while the binary fraction with periods 
between 1--5 day is 93\%. which
is significantly different from the binary fraction of all cool APOGEE dwarfsby a
p-value of less than \(10^4\). The p-value for the binary fraction for stars
with periods between 5--13 days is a marginal 0.005. For the long-period
interval of 13--17 days, the p-value is 0.09, indicating a binary fraction
representative of the full sample.

    respectively}\label{fig:mcq_rapid_excess}
\end{figure*}

While the spectroscopic sample can show trends between rotation and binarity in
large bins, the substantially larger photometric sample is needed to 
effectively characterize the rapid rotators. The vertical displacement of stars 
in each period bin is shown in \cref{fig:mcq_rapid_excess}. With the 
substantially larger number of objects in each bin, the absence of the
single-star sequence in the rapid rotators is starker.

\begin{figure*}[htb]

    \label{fig:mcquillan_transition}
\end{figure*}

The appearance of the single-star sequence is shown in
\cref{fig:mcquillan_transition}. The single-star sequence appears in the
hottest bin first, with cooler stars having a longer-period tail. The trend
that hotter stars in the field rotate more quickly than the cooler stars 
is consistent with the overall trend in temperature seen in 
\citet{McQuillan14}.

        vertical displacement threshold. \emph{Bottom Right:}
        Same as the previous plot, except with the more conservative vertical
        displacement threshold. Error bars are 1-\(\sigma\) Poisson confidence 
    intervals.}\label{fig:binary_fraction}
\end{figure*}

In order to understand the low-period edge of the single-star population, as
well as the cutoff period for the tidally-synchronized binaries, we need to
quantify the behavior illustrated in
\cref{fig:mcq_rapid_excess,fig:mcquillan_transition}. One measure to trace
changes in behavior between the binaries and single stars is the photometric
binary fraction, shown in the top row of \cref{fig:binary_fraction}. The rapid 
rotators show a uniquely high binary fraction not seen in any other period 
range, which is robust to the choice of detection threshold. As was 
qualitatively shown in \cref{fig:mcquillan_transition}, the binary fraction 
decreases around 7 days, which is expected for when the single-star tail comes 
into the population. However, it does not reach the mean binarity of the full 
sample until around 9--11 days, which may mean that the field cutoff period
occurs in that range.

We also find that the period dependence of the photometric binaries and
photometric singles differ in the short-period domain. The fraction of
photometric binaries as well as the fraction of
photometric single stars is given in the bottom row of
\cref{fig:binary_fraction} as a function of period for both the inclusive and 
conservative binarity thresholds. The number of photometric binaries and 
photometric single stars both decrease in the short-period regime compared to the 
long-period regime; however the photometric single stars decrease much more 
steeply than the photometric binary stars. The sudden drop in photometric 
single stars implies a mixed photometric binary/single population at long 
periods, and a binary-dominated population at short periods. As seen with the
photometric binaries, a tail of 
single stars appears at rotation periods greater than 7 days for both the 
inclusive and conservative binarity thresholds. The relative contributions of 
photometric and single stars then become fixed past 9 days, consistent with 
the flattening of the photometric binary fraction. 

Given the radical difference in behavior between the photometric binaries and
photometric single stars in the short-period regime, we propose that the 
rapid rotators are dominated by tidally-synchronized binaries. The 
short-period systems that do not show significant vertical displacement are 
likely low mass-ratio systems. This interpretation of the photometric singles 
in the rapid rotators is supported by comparing the photometric binary 
fraction of the eclipsing binaries to that of the rapid rotators. The 
photometric binary fraction of the eclipsing binaries with orbital periods 
less than seven days is \(78 \pm 15\%\) with the inclusive threshold and 
\(64 \pm 14\%\) with the conservative threshold, while the photometric 
binary fraction of the rapid rotators with rotation periods less than seven 
days is \(72 \pm 6\%\) with the inclusive threshold and \(60 \pm 5\%\) with 
the conservative threshold.  

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption{Comparison of rapid rotator period distribution and eclipsing

\citep{McQuillan14} sample consists of binaries inclined enough to show
starspot modulation, but not inclined enough to eclipse. Error bars represent
1-\(\sigma\) Poisson confidence intervals.}\label{fig:eclipseprob}
\end{figure}

The short-period rapid rotators also behave like a population of non-eclipsing
binaries, providing further evidence that the rotation period and orbital
periods are identical. We test the assumption of synchronicity by comparing the
rapid rotator population to the non-eclipsing population predicted by the
eclipsing binaries. The probability of a given binary being oriented in such a
way that it will eclipse is \((R_1 + R_2)/a\), where \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are
the primary and secondary radii, which we infer using the MIST isochrones, 
and \(a\) is the semimajor axis of the orbit, which can be derived from the
orbital period and isochrone masses using Kepler's third law.
This expression assumes circular orbits, which is justified because
short-period, low-mass systems are overwhelmingly observed to be circularized
\citep{Raghavan10,VanEylen16}. We also assume a detection efficiency of 100\%
for eclipsing systems, which is justified for short-period systems based on 
\Kepler{}'s duty cycle \citep{Kirk16}. To simplify the calculation, we
assume that the secondaries are half as massive as the primaries, which is
generally consistent with a flat mass-ratio distribution \citep{Raghavan10}. 
More massive secondaries would reduce the predicted number of non-eclipsing 
systems. We also eliminate systems with \(\sin i > 1/2\) because starspot
modulations would not be detected for these highly-inclined systems 
\citep{Jackson10,Rebull17}. Given these assumptions, and the observed 
population of eclipsing binaries, we predict the period distribution of 
non-eclipsing binaries in \cref{fig:eclipseprob}. 

The two period distributions match well below 7 days, indicating
that the rotational period distribution is reflects the orbital period
distribution for the eclipsing binaries. The period at which the data diverges
from the prediction is also similar to the period where the binary fraction 
drops in \cref{fig:binary_fraction}. The concordance of these two periods 
suggests that the short-period systems are mostly binaries following a 
rotational period distribution compatible with the eclipsing binaries, while 
the long-period systems become dominated by single stars following a different 
period distribution. Our physical interpretation for this phenomenon is that the
short-period systems are tidally-synchronized binaries, which remain 
synchronized at least through an orbital period of 7 days. At periods longer
than 7 days, the sample becomes dominated by a rapidly-rotating tail of single
stars and wide binaries following single-star angular momentum evolution.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{photometric_massratio}
    \caption{Luminosity excess of a binary with a 0.7 M\(_\sun\), solar
    metallicity primary as a function of mass ratio using MIST models. The
dashed lines denote the limit at which the luminosity excess is -0.3 mag.}
    \label{fig:photometric_massratio}
\end{figure}

We attempt to generalize our results from just the photometric binaries to the
full binary population. This generalization requires a mapping between the
observed photometric binary fraction and the true binary fraction. We use the
MIST models to predict the fraction of binaries which will be detected as
photometric binaries under the assumption of a flat mass-ratio distribution
\citep{Raghavan10}. As noted in \cref{fig:photometric_massratio}, for a 0.7
solar mass star only mass-ratios greater than 0.7 result in photometric
binaries, implying that 70\% of the binary population in our sample is not
detected as a photometric binary. This rough calculation by itself leads to a
contradiction with the observed short-period photometric binary fraction in 
\cref{fig:binary_fraction} of 0.75. This contradiction requires that our
assumption of a flat mass-ratio function cannot hold.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{distance_dist}
    \caption{Distribution of distances for the photometric binary (blue) and
    photometric single (red) samples, normalized to the total number of
photometric binaries and photometric singles, respectively.}
    \label{fig:distance_dist}
\end{figure}

While the observed mass-ratio function for short-period systems cannot be flat,
whether the curvature is intrinsic to the short-period binary population or due
to the \Kepler{} selection function is not clear. The distribution of 
distances for the photometric binaries and photometric single stars, shown in
\cref{fig:distance_dist} show that photometric binaries are overrepresented in
the sample. If both the photometric binaries and photometric single stars were
observed in an unbiased way, except for differing luminosity cutoffs, the two
distributions in \cref{fig:distance_dist} would be identical for nearby stars,
until the photometric single stars fell below \Kepler{}'s detection threshold.
The difference in the distributions for even nearby stars implies that the
\Kepler{} selection function was not uniformly sensitive to both binaries and
single stars. As a result, more detailed modeling of how binarity affected the
\Kepler{} selection function is necessary to draw conclusions about the
mass-ratio distribution of the short-period systems.

We validate many of these trends by revisiting them in the smaller, but more
well-characterized spectroscopic sample. The spike in the binary fraction
between 1--7 days (top rows of \cref{fig:binary_fraction}) can be seen in the 
spectroscopic sample as well as the dropoff in photometric single stars at
short periods (bottom rows of \cref{fig:binary_fraction}).

in \citet{ElBadry18b}.}
    \label{fig:elbadry_excess}
\end{figure}

While we assumed that objects showing large vertical displacement were
binaries, our sample includes an abundance of systems with vertical
displacements greater than 0.75 mag, some greater than even 1.3 mag. One
obvious explanation for these systems is that they are multiple systems of
comparable mass. Equal-mass multiple systems are expected to be rare, which
does not adequately explain these targets. One other explanation is that the 
secondary causes biases the observed temperature to be cooler than the actual 
primary temperature \citep{Pinsonneault12,ElBadry18a}, causing the single-star 
luminosity to be underestimated. 

We can test the effect of binarity on the estimated temperature by using the
APOGEE DR13 targets whose spectra were fit for multiple solutions
\citep{ElBadry18b}. In cases where a two-component fit was favored, temperature
were published for both the primary and secondary. With \Gaia{} DR2 parallaxes,
we can actually test how often two photometric components were successfully
detected. All the DR13 objects analyzed by \citet{ElBadry18b} are shown in
\cref{fig:elbadry_excess} with both the ASPCAP and decomposed temperatures.

The overall behavior in the \citet{ElBadry18b} sample is that the effect of 
binarity is substantial, leading to incorrectly-inferred magnitude excesses of
up to 0.3 mag. For many of the intermediate mass-ratio objects, the 
ASPCAP-inferred primary temperature may be off by several hundred Kelvin, 
leading an overestimation of the K-band vertical displacement by up to 0.3 
mag. The difference in temperature is less severe for targets with high 
luminosity excesses, which is to be expected because the two stellar 
components would have similar spectra. However, the effect is still 
non-negligible.

While the two-component fit produces results that overall seem reasonable, many
of its decompositions were not compatible with the vertical displacement. Many
of the photometric binaries were not flagged as requiring two-component fits.
Additionally, two of the targets showing essentially no vertical displacement
were flagged as having substantial modifications to the temperature from a
companion. Nonetheless, the results of the analysis by \citet{ElBadry18b} are
impressive given that it did not make use of \Gaia{} parallaxes. Future
analyses may want to make use of the vertical displacement when flagging
spectra for multiple-component fits.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We calculated K-band luminosity excesses above the main sequence for the full
\citet{McQuillan14} sample. As seen in both a spectroscopically-characterized
subset as well as in the general sample, rapid rotators with periods between
1--7 days show substantially larger luminosity excesses than the slower
rotators. At periods longer than 7 days, the rapidly rotating tail of the
single-star population grows more numerous before dominating the sample at
periods longer than 9 days. 

We propose that the excess of binaries among rapid rotators is a sign of
tidally-synchronized binaries dominating the short-period of the rotation
distribution. When comparing the rotational period distribution of the rapid 
rotators to the orbital period distribution of \Kepler{} eclipsing binaries, we
find that the rapid rotators are consistent with being synchronized, 
non-eclipsing binary systems showing starspot modulation, up to periods of 7
days.

\input{tables/table1}

Our hypothesis that the rapid rotators are tidally-synchronized systems can be
readily tested using time-resolved moderate-resolution spectroscopy. A binary
with two 0.7 M\(_\sun\) stars in a 7 day period orbit should have an RV
semiamplitude of 62 \kms. If these systems were truly synchronized, the
RV-derived orbital period should be identical to the photmetric rotation
period. A list of the rapid rotators with 1 day < \(P_{rot}\) < 7 day, along
with relevant information is shown in \cref{tab:rapidrot}.

A substantial population of tidally-synchronized binaries in the short-period 
regime requires that care be taken before interpreting short rotational 
periods as being signatures of youth in the \Kepler{} field. Questions of 
youth in the \Kepler{} field will either have to use different methodologies 
that don't rely on rotation- or activity-age relations, or will have to
model the population of tidally-synchronized background to subtract it away. 

We also note that the K-band bolometric corrections in the MIST isochrones
overpredict the dependence on metallicity, even near solar metallicity. We
derived corrections for trends imposed by the MIST isochrones which reduced the
scatter in the single-star sequence. In the era of \Gaia{} parallaxes,
additional testing can be done to validate bolometric corrections in the
sparsely-calibrated NIR region.
