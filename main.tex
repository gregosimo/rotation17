\section{Introduction}

Rotation is a fundamental property of stars; it impacts their lifetimes, can
induce mixing, and can serve as a population diagnostic. Stars are also born 
with a wide range of rotation rates \citep{Attridge92, Herbst00, Henderson12}.
With a strong dependence on stellar mass. \citet{Kraft67} noted a dichotomy in
rotation rates among field stars hotter than 6200 K rotating with a wide range
of \vsini, and those cooler than 6200 K, including the Sun, rotation with
largely undetectable \vsini. This abrupt transition is due to the onset of
convective envelopes for lower-mass stars, which enables efficient angular
momentum loss through magnetized winds \citep{Parker58,Weber67}.

The strong dependence of angular momentum loss on rotation \citep{Kawaler88}
leads to the rapid convergence of a wide range of rotation rates to a unique
value for stars older than 0.5 Gyr \citep{Pinsonneault89}. Rotation is
therefore a potentially valuable age diagnostic for stellar populations
\citep{Skumanich72}; this has been used to derive empirical relationships for
field populations, sometimes referred to as gyrochronology \citep{Barnes07,
Mamajek08, Meibom09}.  

Angular momentum evolution models have usually been calibrated using rotation periods in
star clusters, which have known ages and are easily characterized
\citep{Krishnamurthi97, Gallet13, Somers17}. The calibrating clusters are typically
young (\(< 1\) Gyr), with the behavior at old ages anchored by the Sun. A full 
theoretical treatment of gyrochronology requires evolutionary stellar models 
that include a variety of physical effects (see \citet{Gallet13} for an
overview).

The \Kepler{} satellite \citep{Borucki10,Koch10}, which observed the same
region of the sky for over four years, has revolutionized our ability to
measure stellar rotation. Large-scale analyses have extracted rotation periods
from the light curves of tens of thousands of stars \citep{Nielsen13,
Reinhold13, Garcia14, McQuillan14} in the field. These rotation periods along 
with a field gyrochronology are expected to provide insights on the age 
distribution of the field, and thus provide more accurate representation of 
transiting exoplanets.

The new observations of old field stars enabled by \Kepler{} have challenged 
our theories of angular momentum evolution on multiple fronts. Existing 
gyrochronological models anchored at the Sun have not been able to explain
the rotation of field stars with asteroseismic ages \citep{Angus15, 
VanSaders16}. The \Kepler{} population at long periods shows a sharp
discontinuity which is not predicted by stellar models \citep{VanSaders18}. 
Nearby K- and M-dwarfs show a bimodality in the period distribution which has
no clear explanation in stellar physics \citep{Davenport18}. Additionally,
there are substantially more rapid rotators than predicted
A major puzzle to come out of the large sample of rotation period data is that
around 10\% of the dwarfs observed by \Kepler{} show shorter rotation periods 
than expected for a 1 Gyr population. There have been signs that the
\Kepler{} field may have a larger youthful population than previously expected
\citep{Berger18a}. While the rate of rapid rotators is in potential agreement
with a larger population of young stars, rapid rotators can also be explained
by other properties other than youth.


As a galactic field population the \Kepler{} field contains heterogeneous
mixture of stellar populations not compatible with existing gyrochronological
relations which have been difficult to disentangle using only photometry.
Subgiants, while being rare in clusters, make up 20\% of \Kepler{} targets
\citep{Gaidos13, Berger18b}. Since the subgiant population consists of stars
expanding off the main sequence from above the Kraft break, they obey a
different gyrochronology relation than that calibrated for dwarfs in clusters
\citep{vanSaders13}. Binaries form an additional source of contamination in the
field. In addition to the secondary's flux causing mismatched stellar
parameters \citep{ElBadry18,Jackson18}, binaries close enough to tidally
interact will be off the gyrochronology relationship entirely. Understanding
the age distribution of the \Kepler{} field will require characterizing the
background population of tidally-synchronized binaries.

In addition to providing better ages, a large sample of tidally-synchronized
binaries would be valuable in and of itself. These systems are intrinsically
rare and usually require significant spectroscopic resources to discover and
characterize \citep{Mathieu90, Raghavan10, Geller15}. Close binaries tend to be
found in triple systems \citep{Tokovinin06}. The tighest systems are predicted
to actually experience significant orbital period evolution over the age of the
Milky Way, predicting a population of merger products \citep{Andronov06}.
Characterizing the close, tidally-synchronized firled population will enable us
to predict the prevalence of mergers in the field as well as compare merger
rates to those observed in clusters.

The availability of \Gaia{} DR2 parallaxes \citep{Gaia18,Lindegren18} has
enabled us to better characterize sources of rapid rotation beyond that
available through photometry and spectroscopy. Young single stars would be
observed as rapid rotators within the field main sequence. Subgiants would be
substantially more luminous than the main sequence due to the expansion of
their stellar envelopes. Lastly, binaries should be up to twice as luminous as
the main sequence, extending up to 0.75 mag above the single-star sequence.
While these populations overlap for hot stars, the subgiants and binaries
should separate cleanly on the lower main sequence.

An additional constraint on the populations comes from the substantial sample
of spectroscopically-characterized dwarfs from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) \citep{Majewski17}. Approximately 5000 dwarfs and subgiants
have been observed in the \Kepler{} field with reliable effective temperature
and metallicities \citep{Holtzmann18}. This sample will be valuable for
understanding the importance of metallicity to identify populations of
binaries.

This paper will attempt to measure the prevlanece of photometric binaries among
hte rapid rotators in \citep{McQuillan14}. In Section 2, we will describe our
sample, as well as the data used to select binaries from the sample. In Section
3, we demonstrate the regime where binaries can be successfully distinguished
from subgiants with both the presence and absence of metallicity information.
Section 4 illustrates our results of the prominene of binaries among the rapid
rotators. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our results for the population
of rapid rotators and lay out future avenues to explore.

\section{Catalog Data}
\label{sec:data}

The base sample of this study consists of \Kepler{} targets with photometric
period detections. All targets in the \Kepler{} field have stellar parameters
determined at the very least by KIC photometry \citep{Brown11}. The total
number of objects with period detections is 34,030.

We also examine a spectroscopically-characterized subsample from APOGEE\. This
sample has measured metallicity as well as spectroscopically-determined
temperatures. The overlap between this sample and the \citet{McQuillan14}
period detections is 1,244.

To calculate vertical displacements above the main sequence, we use photometry
from 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie06}, parallaxes from Gaia DR2 \citep{Gaia18}, along
with \Teff{} and extinction values estimated from the \Kepler{} Stellar 
Parameter Catalog DR25 \citep[KSPC]{Huber14,Mathur17}. For the spectroscopic sample,
\Teff{} and [Fe/H] are taken from APOGEE DR14 \citep{Abolfathi18}. More detail
on these catalogs is given below.

\subsection{Default Stellar Parameters}

Stellar parameters for the full \Kepler{} sample are available as part of the
\Kepler{} Stellar Parameter Catalog DR25 \citep[KSPC]{Mathur17}. The KSPC
compiles stellar parameters from the literature and simultaneously fits them
using DSEP \citep{Dotter08} stellar evolutionary tracks via the methodology of
\citet{Huber14}. Revised stellar parameters, such as \Teff, as well as inferred
quantities, such as distance and extinction, are output along with asymmetric
1-\(\sigma\) uncertainties. Most \Kepler{} targets just have
photometrically-derived input values from the KIC \citep{Brown11}, but in cases
where more precise constraints can be found in the literature, such as
spectroscopic parameters, those are inputted instead.

For this paper, we also make use of extinctions and distances from the KSPC\.
Unlike the temperature, which is fit directly to the grid of models, the
distance and extinction are inferred from the predicted absolute magnitude and
a 3D extinction map \citep{Amores05} The extinction is given as \(A_V\), which we
convert to other bands using the \citep{Cardelli89} extinction law.

\subsection{Astrometric Data}

The ability to distinguish between different evolutionary states of stars is
enabled by parallaxes derived from the \Gaia{} mission's Data Release 2
\citep{Gaia18}. The Gaia DR2 performed a fully consistent single-star
5-parameter (\(\alpha\), \(\delta\), \(\mu_\alpha\), \(\mu_\delta\), \(\pi\))
solution to 1.3 billion sources over 22 months of observations
\citep{Lindegren18}. For targets which could not be adequately fit with a
single-star 5-parameter solution, a 2-parameter (\(\alpha\), \(\delta\))
solution is performed instead \citep{Michalik15}. The criteria for a
2-parameter fall-back solution include targets with Gaia \(G > 21.0\), having
fewer than 6 visibility periods of observations, and an error ellipse larger
than a magnitude-dependent limit in its largest dimension \citep{Lindegren18}.

% APOGEE Targeted sample APOKASC (APOKASC + Cool Dwarf - faint dwarfs) - 7642
% Not bad APOGEE targeted sample - 7395
% Good APOGEE with good K detection - 7373
% Good APOGEE in Gaia - 6961

We use  cross-matched database of \citet{Berger18b} to match \Kepler{} targets
against \Gaia{} DR2 detections.
\citet{Berger18b} based their sample on the Kepler Stellar Parameter Pipeline
DR25 \citep{Mathur17}, and cross-matched those sources against \Gaia{} DR2
using both position and G-band flux. Of the successfully cross-matched targets,
\citet{Berger18b} excluded objects with fractional parallax errors greater than
0.2, \(\Teff < 3000\) K, \(\logg < 0.1\), or with low-quality 2MASS photometry. 
We converted parallax to distance modulus by using an
exponentially-decreasing volume density prior with a 1.35 kpc length scale
\citep{BailerJones15,Astraatmadja16}, and correcting for the zero-point offset
of 0.5 mas \citep{Zinn18}. \gvs{Should we include a table of this?} In 
addition to the most probable solutions, the 1-\(\sigma\) asymmetric 
confidence intervals for distances were also reported by \citet{Berger18b}.

\subsection{Photometric Data}

In order to characterize our stellar sample, we chose to use absolute K-band
magnitude as a proxy for luminosity. K-band apparent magnitudes were measured
by the 2MASS survey \citep{Skrutskie06}, which has profile-fit photometry with 
uncertainties available for nearly the full sample. A small fraction of 
targets (1.5\%) of the \citet{McQuillan14} sample have photometry flagged due
to blending. To avoid contaminating the binary sequence with blended objects,
we exclude these targets.

We chose to use K-band magnitudes because the measurement uncertainties
associated with it are low. The typical K uncertainty for the
\citep{McQuillan14} sample is 0.03 mag. The typical extinction and its
uncertainty in our sample is \(A_V = 0.33\), and \(\sigma_{A_V}=0.025\).
Applying the \citet{Cardelli89} relation that \(A_K/A_V = 0.114\), the effect
of extinction itself shrinks to the level of photometric errors. While we
include the extinctions to avoid biasing our sample, the use of K-band makes us
confident that our results are not significantly impacted by extinction.

Because the signature of binarity is substantially larger than the
uncertainties of hte measurements, we eschew detailed modeling of the
uncertainties in favor of the simpler approach of adding the uncertainties in
quadrature to obtain an absolute magnitude. Most of the sample is either
strongly dominated by photometric errors or distance errors, and this treatment
will do an appropriate job of approximating the uncertainties in the measured
absolute magnitude.

\subsection{Rotation Data}

The rotation periods for our sample are derived from \citet{McQuillan14}, 
which is to-date the largest homogeneous analysis of rotational variability in
\Kepler{} stars. \citet{McQuillan14} selected their sample to have photometric
\(\Teff < 6500\) K \citep{Brown11,Dressing13}, and implemented the color-color
and \logg{} cuts advocated in \citet{Ciardi11}, which ranged from \(\logg = 
3.5\) at 6000 K to \(\logg = 4.0\) at 4250 K. 
In addition to the temperature and gravity cuts, \citet{McQuillan14} also 
excluded known eclipsing binaries and plantary transit candidates. 

Rotational periods in \citet{McQuillan14} were measured by calculating the 
autocorrelation function and fitting the location of multiple peaks. In lieu 
of visual verification of the autocorrelation function, \citet{McQuillan14}
performs two automated tests to distinguish physical periodicity from
instrumental artifacts or other sources of variability. First, the 
periodicity must be consistent in different segments of the light curve.
Secondly, the height of the first peak must be larger than a temperature- and
period-dependent threshold. In order to reduce contamination from pulsators, 
\citet{McQuillan14} only considered periods between 0.2--70 days.

    \label{fig:mcquillan_selection}
\end{figure}

The distribution of \citet{McQuillan14} targets is shown in a \Teff-\(M_K\)
diagram in \cref{fig:mcquillan_selection}, using pre- and post-\Gaia{}
distances. One of the new results enabled by \Gaia{} is that a binary sequence,
located above the main sequence, is clearly seen. Additionally, many of the
period detections on the giant branch have gone away, which is to be expected
since red giants are expected to be slowly rotating. There are also a
collection of objects several magnitudes brighter than the main sequence, but
cooler than the red giant branch. These are interesting objects worth
following-up.

The period detection fraction also shows encouraging trends in
\cref{fig:mcquillan_selection}. Cooler stars tend
to be more spotted, indicating an increase in spottiness on the lower main
sequence. An interesting feature we note is that the detection fraction shows a
bifurcation between the main sequence and binary sequence hotter than about
4500 K. While we do not delve in the feature, we point out its existence, and
that it is consistent with evolution of activity on the single-star sequence, 
with more evolved stars having fewer spots detections.

\subsection{Spectroscopic Parameters}

We draw our spectroscopic sample from the Data Release 14 \citep{Abolfathi18}
of the APOGEE survey \citep{Majewski17}. The workhorse behind the survey is the
APOGEE spectrograph, a high-resolution (\(R \sim 22,000\)) multi-fiber
near-infrared spectrograph \citep{Wilson10}, mounted on the SDSS 2.5-meter
telescope at Apache Point Observatory \citep{Gunn06}.

Reduction of the APOGEE data takes place in three main stages. First,
individual visit spectra are reduced, including detector calibration, bad pixel
masking, wavelength calibration, sky substraction, and determination of
individual radial velocities through cross-correlation of template spectra.
Second, the individual spectra are combined by correcting for radial velocity
differences between the exposures, either by cross-correlating with each other,
or with template spectra, whichever leads to a smaller scatter (Holtzman et
al, in prep). The full process is detailed in \citet{Nidever15}.

The final step is the extraction of stellar parameters and chemical abundances
by the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP)
\citep{GarciaPerez16}. ASPCAP measures stellar parameters by performing a
chi-squared minimization \citep{AllendePrieto06} over a 6-dimensional space of
\Teff, \logg, [M/H], [\(\alpha\)/M], \vsini, and microturbulent velocity.

After determination of the stellar parameters, they are calibrated to the
photometric system of \citet{GonzalezHernandez09} using a metallicity-dependent
offset. After calibration, the scatter between the calibrated and photometric
temperatures  were found to be a strong function of \Teff{}, ranging from 130 
K at 5500 K down to 85 K at 4000 K (Holtzman et al.\ in prep) for solar
metallicity objects observed at a signal-to-noise ratio of 100. 

We inspected the fits to a representative set of spectra for targets flagged 
by the ASPCAP pipeline as having potential quality problems. A small fraction
(2.5\%) of targets have the \STARBAD{} quality flag enabled. Visual inspection
of a representative sample of spectra indicated that the flag was largely the
result of poor subtraction or normalization of the spectrum in the pipeline. Or
due to poor model fits on the cool (\(\Teff < 4250 K\)) end. We did not find
that the presence of a secondary triggered this flag, so we exclude these
targets from further analysis. A substantially larger fraction of targets
(14\$) have the \STARWARN{} quality flag enabled. Visual inspection of the
spectra indicated that the fit reasonably resembed the target spectra. Because
we did not find any clear problems with stellar parameter determinations, we 
included these objects in our sample.

        color-selected asteroseismic targets, while the small purple dot

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:apogee_selection} shows all \Kepler{} targets with observed
spectroscopic temperatures in the APOGEE DR14, color-coded by observing
program. One of the driving efforts for \Kepler{} field observations has been
the spectroscopic characterization of asteroseismic targets, shown as small
green, blue and purple dots \citep{Zasowski17,Pinsonneault18}. These
observations have been substantially biased toward giants and subgiants. A
complementary program aimed to observe the full \Kepler{} sample cooler than
5500 K and brighter than \(H < 11\). This sample ended up observing about 1,200
targets, shown as small red dots. Another \(\sim 1400\) observations have been
made to characterize \Kepler{} planet hosts with \(H < 14\), shown as purple
diamonds. Lastly around 200 eclipsing binaries \citep{Prsa11,Slawson11} were
also observed, and are shown as light blue circles.

While our analysis of rapid rotators only uses the subset of APOGEE targets
with period detections, the full APOGEE sample is useful for characterizing the
shape of the single-star sequence. Therefore, in Section~\ref{sec:binaries},
where we describe characterizing the single-star sequence, we will use the full
APOGEE sample. In Section~\ref{sec:results}, where we analyze only the behavior
of the rapid rotators, we only use the 1058 APOGEE targets with
\citet{McQuillan14} detections.

\section{Stellar Models}

\gvs{Under construction}

Our fiducial single-star model is the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program
\citep[DSEP]{Dotter08}. The DSEP models incorporate gravitational settling of
Helium and metals, standard convection including core overshooting, and PHOENIX
model atmospheres to set the surface boundary condition \citep{Hauschildt99a,
Hauschildt99b}. Stars containing a Helium flash are not continuously modeled,
but are re-generated starting from the zero-age horizontal branch; however, as
we are only interested in the main sequence, this should not be a
concern\citep{Dotter08}.

The DSEP models have proven successful at producing the optical color-magnitude
diagram and luminosity functions of globular clusters at a wide range of
metallicities \citep{Dotter07}. It has also been successful at predicting
near-infrared isochrones in M67 \citep{Sarajedini09}. As such, we expect it to
do well at predicting K-band magnitudes for \Kepler{} cool dwarfs.

In order to derive K-band magnitudes for the spectroscopic sample, we 
interpolate over \Teff{} and [Fe/H]
assuming solar alpha abundance and a fiducial age of 5.5 Gyr, representative
of the typical age of the thick disk. For the sample drawn from
\citet{McQuillan14}, without spectroscopic [Fe/H], we assume the mean
metallicity of the overlap sample with APOGEE\@.


\subsection{Comparison to other isochrones}

To probe the systematic uncertainties of the DSEP isochrone, we compare them to
the MIST isochrones \citep{Dotter16, Choi16}. The MIST isochrones are based on 
the outputs of the MESA stellar evolutionary models \citep{Paxton11, Paxton13, 
Paxton15}. The MIST isochrones adopt different physical prescriptions for their
models, including atomic diffusion prescriptions, reaction rates, boundary
conditions, mixing length, and overshooting prescriptions. We refer the reader
to the source papers for further details on the internal physics of both
models.

We use version 1.1 of the non-rotating MIST isochrones with solar alpha
abundance. The isochrones are interpolated over \Teff{} and [Fe/H] in an
identical manner. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{MIST_DSEP_age}
    \caption{Difference in predicted K-band magnitude between solar-metallicity 
    MIST and DSEP isochrones for three ages: 1 Gyr (solid), 5.5 Gyr (dashed), 
and 10 Gyr (dotted).}\label{fig:mist_dsep_age}
\end{figure}

The first test of the isochrones is of the age and \Teff{} dependence of the
solar metallicity isochrones. At three given ages, we generate the
solar-metallicity Teff-Ks relation, and subtract the two relations from each
other. The residuals are shown in \cref{fig:mist_dsep_age}. For the 5.5 Gyr
isochrone, the uncertainties are less than 0.05 mag between \(4500 K \le \Teff
\le 5900 K\). At higher temperatures, the larger differences are driven by
different behaviors near the turn-off. Because we are interested in measuring
luminosity excesses above the main sequence that are not driven by age
evolution, stars hot enough to have evolved significantly in their lifetime
will be excluded from the analysis. The disagreement below 4500 K is more
puzzling. Additional analysis will have to be done to ensure that the
isochrones are not doing terribly here. \gvs{I note that in
    \citet{Sarajedini09}, the region where the DSEP and MIST isochrones
    disagree is the same region in M67 where J-K color becomes insensitive to
    \Teff{}. So more work will have to be done to show that the DSEP isochrones
aren't going crazy in this regime.}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{MIST_DSEP_metallicity}
    \caption{Difference in predicted K-band magnitude between 5.5 Gyr 
        MIST and DSEP isochrones for six temperatures: 6000 K (purple),
        5500 K (turquoise), 5000 K (blue), 4500 K (aqua), 4000 K (green), and
    3500 K (yellow).}\label{fig:mist_dsep_metallicity}
\end{figure}

After establishing the behavior of the isochrones at solar metallicity, we also
trace their behavior at different metallicities.
\cref{fig:mist_dsep_metallicity} shows the predicted K-band magnitudes between
DSEP and MIST at given \Teff{}s over a wide range of metallicities. The
isochrones generally behave well in the regime warmed than 4500 K, below which
the isochrone behaviors diverge substantially. Particularly near solar, the
uncertainties are on the order of 0.05 for \(\Teff > 4500 K\).

Based on this comparison between isochrones, we conclude that the predicted 
DSEP K-band magnitudes have a systematic uncertainty of 0.05 for when
\(Teff > 4500 K\) and 0.15 when \(\Teff < 4500 K\).

\subsection{Comparison to Data}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{metallicity_bins}
    \caption{\Teff-K diagram of four metallicity bins of stars classified by 
        \citet{Berger18b} as being on the main sequence. The red dashed lines
    indicate DSEP isochrones with metallicity given by the bin 
edges.}\label{fig:metallicity_bins}
\end{figure}

In addition to measuring the systematic uncertainty of the isochrone with
respect to other isochrones, we also attempt to measure the error of the
isochrone with respect to the data. To accomplish this, we split the data into
four metallicity bins, and attempt to measure the scatter of the points with
respect to the isochrones. The bins are shown in \cref{fig:metallicity_bins} 
\gvs{I realize that this isn't actually a good
strategy to quantify the uncertainty of the isochrone. Will need to discuss
with Marc.} 

\subsubsection{Low metallicity}

Of all the bins, it's clear that the lowest metallicity bin does not match the
theoretical isochrones at all. While it's possible that the isochrones predict
the K-band magnitudes of metal-poor stars poorly, it's more plausible that
metal-poor main-sequence stars are more likely to be excluded due to the
magnitude-limited sample. Aside from being intrinsically less luminous at a
given temperature, metal-poor stars are also rare in the thick disk, and would
only be found at greater distances. Due to both of these effects, it's likely
that only the brighest metal-poor stars, namely those in multiple star systems 
or otherwise peculiar would be included in APOGEE's selection criteria.

To test this, we take the distances of the observed metal-poor objects, predict
a main-sequence H-band absolute magnitude based on the temperature, and check 
to see if it would be fall under APOGEE's inclusion criteria. The distribution
of predicted apparent H-band magnitudes are shown in \cref{fig:metal_poor}.
\gvs{NOTE: Actually do this exercise.}

\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

\gvs{Under Construction}

The crucial quantity we measure for these samples is the vertical displacement
above the main sequence. Vertical displacement has been calculated many times
in clusters \citep{Mermillod92}, where the main sequence is described by a
single-age stellar population with a uniform metallicity. Measuring the
vertical displacement for a field population is more challenging, because the
field consists of a heterogeneous sample of ages and metallicities. In order to
successfully measure a single-star sequence we must either control for or
characterize these additional factors. 

The vertical displacement consists of two parts: the measured K-band
luminosity of a star, and the inferred luminosity of a single star with the
same temperature and metallicity as the original one at a reference age. The 
former is well-constrained and easily calculated quantity given the 2MASS 
photometry and the \Gaia{} parallax. The latter requires a single-star model.

We use the MIST \citep{Dotter16,Choi16} isochrones to model the 
single-star lower main sequence. For a full description of the MIST 
isochrones, we refer the reader to the source papers, as well as the MESA 
instrument papers \citep{Paxton11, Paxton13, Paxton15}, which is the stellar 
model on which the isochrones are based. The MIST isochrones at solar
metallicity are shown in \cref{fig:rawk} and behave as expected for a field
star population.

In order to characterize the vertical displacement, we select 1 Gyr isochrones 
because they span a wide range of temperatures without imposing
structure from the turnoff. This is necessary for us to draw a threshold where 
age effects become unimportant compared to binarity. Because we will 
ultimately be working on the lower main sequence, where age evolution is 
negligible, the choice of isochrone should not affect our result. 

The vertical displacement of the full APOGEE sample is shown in 
\cref{fig:sample_dk}. For every star, the displacement is calculated by
subtracting the luminosity of the 1 Gyr isochrone at that star's metallicity.
The lower main sequence has now been flattened and goes through the x-axis. The
upper main sequence lies above the isochrone, which is to be expected because
K-band luminosity is substantially more sensitive to age for more massive
stars. In order to separate the cool dwarfs from the base of the red giant 
branch, we draw a limit of 1.3 magnitudes more luminous. This limit
cleanly excludes red giant branch stars while providing generous allowance for
binaries and potential triple systems.

\subsection{\Kepler{} Dwarf Metallicity}

For the full \citet{McQuillan14} sample, where individual metallicities are not
available, we want to select an isochrone that is representative of the full 
sample. We do this by assuming that metallicity distribution the spectroscopic 
targets is representative of the full \Kepler{} field. 

Because we will mostly be concerned with the cool dwarfs, we check the
metallicity distribution of dwarfs cooler than 5500 K, based on 
\cref{fig:sample_dk}. The metallicity distribution is shown in
\cref{fig:metallicity}. The median metallicity is 0.08 with a 1-\(\sigma\)
confidence interval ranging from -0.14--0.23. A slightly super-solar
metallicity distribution is consistent with that observed for planet hosts by 
the California \Kepler{} survey \citep{Petigura17}.  We therefore treat the \([Fe/H] =
0.08\) isochrone as the representative one where metallicity is unknown, and
note that the majority of the sample 

\subsection{Corrections for Spectroscopic Sample}

Because our analysis only depends on the vertical displacement above the main
sequence, and not absolute position, we correct separately for trends in the
main sequence left over after isochrone subtraction. The NIR behavior of MIST 
isochrones have not been comprehensively tested at a wide range of 
metallicities \citep{Choi18}.

The first trend we want to understand is at which temperature threshold do age
effects start to become important. Because the dwarf sample consists of a
substantial fraction of photometric binaries, any treatment of the main
sequence would have to be robust to outliers. In order to characterize the main
sequence, we choose to use the 75th percentile, as was done in
\citep{Mermillod92}, where they assumed a population which was 50\% binary and
50\% single. 

The trend in the 75th percentile is shown in \cref{fig:agetrend}. Based on this
figure, the main sequence is flat cooler than \(\Teff < 5000 K\), after which
it trends up due to the effects of age. As a result, we use stars cooler than
5000 K to understand the behavior of the main sequence when age effects are
negligible.

We find and correct for a quadratic trend in the vertical displacement of the
main sequence over metallicity. The trend is shown in \cref{fig:met_trend}.
The trend is set by 5 bins which each have equal numbers of stars. The
temperature of the bin is the mean temperature of all stars in that bin; the
luminosity excess is the 75th percentile of all stars in that bin. We then fit
a quadratic polynomial to those five bins. We quantify the goodness-of-fit as
the median absolute deviation of the top 50th percentile of the luminosity
excesses. Five bins minimized the median absolute deviation, but changing the
number of bins had a very small effect on the quality of the fit for the bulk
of the sample. Only the sparsely populated low-metallicity regime (\([Fe/H] <
-0.5\)) was sensitive to the binning. Because this population is rare, and also
is expected to both be older and have different abundances, we just treat them
as outliers in our analysis.

After correcting the trend in metallicity, we return to correct the trend in
\Teff{}, shown in \cref{fig:apogee_teff_trend}. This trend can be characterized
using a linear fit, done in the same way as in metallicity space. The resulting
points should now be reliably flat. The fact that a binary sequence can still
be seen in the corrected dataset is encouraging that our corrections are
meaningful.

\subsection{Corrections for Photometric Sample}

The photometric sample in \citep{McQuillan14} differs from the spectroscopic
sample in two main ways: the lack of metallicity diagnostics, and the necessity
of using photometric \Teff{} instead of a spectroscopic \Teff{}. Both of these
differences will increase the uncertainty of the inferred single-star K-band
luminosity, but not to the point where it affects our results.

\subsubsection{Metallicity Ignorance}



\subsection{Spectroscopic parameters}

The first step to obtaining a usable spectroscopic sample is to perform a 
quality cut for all targets with APOGEE observations.
Depending on the reduced chi-square of the atmospheric model fit, or
disagreement with photometric temperature relations, the ASPCAP pipeline
may trigger a flag indicating that the ouputted parameters may not be
reliable. We categorized our sample into those with \STARBAD, \STARWARN,
\VSINIWARN{}, and no flag enabled to check the quality of the fits. We
visually inspected the spectra for a representative sample of these
quality classes. 

APOGEE \Teff{} and [Fe/H] uncertainties have largely been characterized.
Holtzmann et al (in prep) calculated an expression for the temperature scatter
for cool dwarfs, which ranges from 135 K at 5500 K to 85 K at 4000 K at solar
metallicity. This is consistent with the scatter between photometric and
spectroscopic \Teff{} measured for the APOKASC dwarfs \citep{Serenelli17}.
Uncertainties in [Fe/H] have also been found to be on the order of 0.1 mag
\citep{Serenelli17}. \gvs{Can also try cross-checking with CKS.}

\subsection{\vsini{} validation}
\label{sec:vsini_check}

\begin{figure*}

    \vsini{} detections. The lines corresponding to \(\sin i = 1\) and
    \(\sin i = 0.5\) are denoted as solid and dashed lines. The hatch
    marks denote the forbidden region where \(\sin i > 1\).\label{fig:comps}}
\end{figure*}


The availability of published \vsini{} is relatively new to the ASPCAP pipeline, only
being included since DR13. As a result, catalog \vsini{}s have not been 
extensively vetted and verified. APOGEE does not provide a reasonable
detection limit, or an estimate on the uncertainty of \vsini{}. 
\citet{Tayar15} performed an analysis comparing APOGEE \vsini{} to literature
\vsini{} for targets studied with high-resolution optical spectroscopy to 
determine the detection limit and
uncertainty for \vsini{} for APOGEE DR12 attempting to detect rotation in red
giants and found a detection threshold of about 7 \kms. We repeat their 
analysis for DR14 spectra in the cool dwarf regime to ensure their results
continue to hold in this new regime. 

A comparison between the overlapping APOGEE and \citet{Bruntt12} targets is shown in
\cref{fig:comps}. Six objects without \vsini{}, classified by the ASPCAP 
pipeline as giants, are not shown. The \citet{Bruntt12} \vsini{} is less than 5 \kms{} for all of 
these objects, making them consistent with APOGEE
nondetections.  In order to characterize the APOGEE \vsini{}s, we model the 
two datasets as being linearly related above a specific detection threshold 
with constant fractional uncertainty. The sample shows a 
discontinuity in the scatter at APOGEE \(\vsini=7\kms\), which we 
interpret as the detection limit of APOGEE, above which \vsini{} yields a 
valid stellar rotation measurement. Since the \citet{Bruntt12} errors are
significantly smaller than the expected APOGEE errors, we performed a simple 
linear regression for all targets with APOGEE \vsini{} above the detection 
limit to obtain the relationship. The two datasets have slopes
consistent with one, but with a significant zero-point offset of 9\%,
the APOGEE \vsini{} being lower than the \citet{Bruntt12}
\vsini{}. We estimated the measurement error by calculating the mean squared 
error of the residuals, yielding a 13\% uncertainty which we adopted as the 
uncertainty in APOGEE \vsini{}.

To make sure that \vsini{} continues to be a reliable measure of rotation for
cool dwarfs, we plot the APOGEE \vsini{} agains the \vsini{} measured from
\citet{Stauffer87} in \cref{fig:comps}. At high \vsini{}, the two datasets 
agree well, even
without the offset seen in the \citet{Bruntt12} sample. Near the the 10
\kms{} \citet{Stauffer87} detection limit, they find a few targets with
much higher \vsini{} than APOGEE detects. While this may be
underestimated noise near the detection limit for \citet{Stauffer87}, we
note that this could also indicate that genuine rapid rotators may be
missed by APOGEE\@.

\gvs{Does this actually support the point? Or is it a distraction now?} 
As an additional check on the quality of \vsini{}, we used the asteroseismic 
sample to compared the measured APOGEE \vsini{} to the equatorial velocity 
derived from the rotational periods \citep{Garcia14} and the asteroseismic 
radii \citep{Serenelli17}. The resulting 
comparison is shown in the right panel of \cref{fig:comps}. We find that
twelve out of \gvs{NUM} asteroseismic targets have
non-physical solutions with \(\sin i > 1\). \gvs{The overlap with Garcia is
much larger, so I need to double-check these}

Seven of the targets with unphysical \vsini{} have \vsini{} values close to 
the detection threshold. Because the errors of 
marginal \vsini{} detections are complicated, it may be possible that these 
are outliers. 

Two of the remaining objects with unphysical \vsini{}, are only
slightly above the predicted equatorial velocity. \gvs{Check the UKIRT images
for these, just in case.} It
is a 1.7-\(\sigma\) difference based on the \vsini{} uncertainty, which
may be consistent as a statistical fluctuation. 

Two other targets can be explained by the measured rotation period actually 
being a half-period detection alias, implying a twice as large equatorial 
velocity. 

The final outlier, KIC 9908400, is so significantly off of the relation
that it can not be explained by either uncertainties or aliasing. However,
it may be adequately explained by contamination of the \Kepler{} PSF\@. 
High-resolution J-band imaging of the \Kepler{} field, provided by the United
Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) reveals a bright, nearby blended companion.
Additionally, KIC 9908400 has a high \Teff{} placing it above the Kraft
break, where convective envelopes are thin;
making spots unlikely. Photometric variation originating from the fainter 
star would explain the mismatch in \vsini{} and rotation period.

To obtain a reliable sample of \vsini{} in our full sample, we also inspected 
the spectra for every target with \(\vsini > 7 \kms\) for the presence of 
double lines. Most targets showed obvious cases of ASPCAP 
fitting a single broad line over two separate narrow features, other cases 
only revealed the second component in individual visit spectra. The targets 
showing double-lined spectra were excluded from the analysis because of
the unreliability of the catalog \vsini{}. More sophisticated future
analyses may be able to disentangle \vsini{} measurements from each component 
\citep{ElBadry18}. There are
also cases where the observed spectra show high RV variability
without a visible second component. We include these cases in our sample
because the measured \vsini{} shouldn't be impacted.

For typical APOGEE 
dwarfs in our temperature range, the claimed precision is about 0.01
dex (Holtzmann et al.\ in prep). \gvs{What did Serenelli et al (2017) say about
metallicity uncertainties?}

\section{Binary Selection}
\label{sec:binaries}

\gvs{Under Construction}

Characterizing the binary population in the rapid rotators requires separating
photometric binaries from other classes of objects which lie above the main
sequence, such as subgiants, metal-rich stars, or high-noise outliers. We first
attempt to exclude subgiants from the sample, then we select a \Teff{} regime
where the dwarf and subgiant branches are sufficiently separated that
photometric binaries can be easily distinguished. Lastly, we classify stars as
being part of photometric binaries if they lie sufficiently off the main
sequence.

\subsection{Subgiant Exclusion}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{turnoff}
    \caption{10 Gyr DSEP models of [Fe/H] = -0.5 (blue), 0.0 (black) and 0.5
    (red) overlayed on the spectroscopic sample. The absolute K-band magnitude
    of the turnoff at all metallicities is shown as the dashed line at \(M_K =
2.7\). Points above the line are a mixture of photometric binaries, main
sequence stars, and subgiants. Points below should be free of 
subgiants.}\label{fig:turnoff}
\end{figure}

We select a regime which should be devoid of subgiants by modeling the turnoff
for a 10 Gyr population, representative of the oldest thick-disk stars.
Zoom-ins of the 10 Gyr turnoff are overlayed on our sample for three different
metallicities in \cref{fig:turnoff}. One useful property of the DSEP
predictions is that the turnoff K-band magnitude is independent of metallicity.
As a result, we restrict ourselves to the sample less luminous than \(M_K =
2.7\) to ensure a clean sample of dwarfs.

\subsection{Unbiased Binary Regime}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \plotone{binarycut}
    \caption{Magnitude difference between each point in the spectroscopic
    sample and the 5.5 Gyr DSEP isochrone with the corresponding [Fe/H]. Green
points are those which meet the magnitude cut in the previous section, cleaned
of subgiants. The horizontal dotted line represents a factor of two increase in
luminosity above the predicted main sequence, characteristic of binaries. The
vertical dashed line indicates the temperature where the photometric binaries
are separated from the subgiant branch.}
    \label{fig:binarycut}
\end{figure}

While the sample has been selected to exclude subgiants, binary statistics on
the hot end will be biased because photometric binaries would fall above the
magnitude cut. This bias is seen in \cref{fig:binarycut}, which shows the
magnitude excess of the dwarf sample selected in the previous section compared
to the more luminous sample. The main sequence isochrones are adjusted for
metallicity, which should reduce the scatter about the zero-point. Above 
5500 K, the sample containing subgiants lies less than 0.75 mag above the 
main sequence, indicating that photometric binaries would have removed in the
magnitude cut. Below 5500 K, the subgiant branch lies above 0.75 mag, and the
population of photometric binaries should be complete.

\subsection{Flagging Binaries}

Binaries are flagged as targets which lie at least 3\(\sigma\) above the
DSEP-predicted single-star isochrone. This uncertainty is
defined\ldots{} \gvs{I'm still working on how to get to the uncertainties.}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\gvs{Under Construction}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{binarity}
  \caption{The absolute K-band magnitude of rapid rotators compared to a 
  fiducial 3 Gyr isochrone. Rapid rotators are shown as dark blue points
while marginal rotators are shown as light blue points. Objects showing
double-lined spectra are denoted with salmon stars. Objects with
ambiguous stellar classification are shown as pentagons. The range of
possible K-band magnitudes achievable on the main sequence are given as
solid lines. The red, black, and blue lines correspond to [Fe/H]=0.5,
0.0, -0.5, respectively.}
  \label{fig:binarity}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{mcq_binarity}
  \caption{Cumulative histograms of the K-band magnitude excess with respect to
      a 3 Gyr solar metallicity isochrone for all cool dwarfs with 
      \citet{McQuillan14} periods. The black line is the magnitude excess
      distribution for the full sample while the blue light is just the rapid
  (\(P_{rot} < 3\) day) rotator sample.\label{fig:mcqbinarity}}
\end{figure}


When plotting rapid rotators on an HR diagram, it is clear that the
overwhelming majority of them lie above the main sequence. To make this
result clearer, we plot temperature against the difference between the
observed magnitude, and the magnitude predicted by the corresponding
metallicity-calibrated DSEP model at a fiducial age of 3 Gyr. The
calculated luminosity excess is shown in \cref{fig:binarity}. The range
of luminosity differences achievable by single-star models of varying
ages only reaches a 0.5 mag excess at the hottest part of the range, and
drops significantly with temperature. Most rapid rotators are beyond the
range achievable by single-star models, and must be in multiple-star
systems.

For the subset of our sample that are photometric rapid rotators, they
also show a clear preference for being multiple-star systems systems.
This is further confirmation that rapid rotation is not common in
isolated single stars.

The tendency for rapid rotators to be in multiple star systems is also
seen in the \citet{McQuillan14} cool dwarfs. To select this sample, we
use the same absolute K-band magnitude and temperature cuts as with the
APOGEE sample. Instead of spectroscopic temperatures, we use photometric 
temperature calculated in \citet{Mathur17}. Because the full \citet{McQuillan14} 
sample does not have metallicity information, we cannot glean a sharp
photometric binary sequence as was seen with the APOGEE sample. Nonetheless,
we can note general trends just by removing the overall \Teff dependence of
\(M_K\) by subtracting off  a single 3 Gyr solar-metallicity
isochrone. Plotted in \cref{fig:mcqbinarity} is the cumulative distribution
function of \citet{McQuillan14} targets with \(P < 3\) day compared to the bulk
sample. It is clear from the figure that rapid rotators tend to be found at
larger magnitude excesses than the bulk sample.

    \caption{Cumulative distribution function of \vsini{} for the combined
        dwarf sample for spectroscopic and photometric rotation data. The 
        rapid rotator fraction at a given \vsini{} threshold
    would be one minus the value of the cumulative distribution function
    at that \vsini{} value. Solid lines denote the cumulative
    distribution function of APOGEE \vsini{} for the subsample with rotation
    periods. Dashed lines denote  
    the cumulative distribution function of \(v_{eq}\) derived from the
    rotation periods and stellar radii. Dotted lines denote the
    cumulative distribution function of \vsini{} for the subsample without
    rotation periods. Error bars represent 
    1-\(\sigma\) binomial confidence levels.\label{fig:detection_fraction}}
\end{figure}

Given that two rotation measures are available for our sample, we also compare 
the spectroscopic and photometric rapid rotator fractions. In order to
ensure that our comparison results are not driven by the particular
\vsini{} detection limit, we perform our comparison at a variety of
\vsini{} limits to ensure that they are robust.

\gvs{Also need a uniform method of dealing with inclination biases.}
In order to obtain a photometric rapid rotator fraction corresponding to
a \vsini{} detection limit, we transformed the \vsini{} threshold into period 
space. The relationship between rotational period and equatorial velocity is 
given by the relation 
\begin{displaymath}
    v_{eq} = \frac{2 \pi R}{P} 
\end{displaymath}
where \(R\) is the equatorial radius and \(P\) is the rotation period. As we
noted in Section~\ref{sec:data}, there is a relatively clean and narrow
relationship between radius and \Teff{} on the main sequence. We used the 
DSEP-derived radius for each individual object to transform  between
velocity and period coordinates. The fraction of objects with period
short enough to produce detectable \vsini{} is shown as the dashed 
lines in \cref{fig:detection_fraction}. The photometric rapid rotator fraction
ranges from 5-8\% for photometric binaries at 0.5-1\% for single stars.

Due to the \(\sin i\) ambiguity, there isn't a direct correlation
between a \vsini{} cut and the corresponding period cut given a stellar radius.
Many rapid rotators in period-space scatter into being non-detections in
velocity space after convolution with the inclination distribution. However,
this distribution can be statistically characterized for randomly
aligned systems showing photometric variability. Studies of spots in young open
clusters indicate that spots only produce variability when \(\sin i < 1/2\). 
Since our underlying sample was chosen based on
\Teff{} and \logg{}, we only expect a strong bias in inclination caused by spot
geometry.
Therefore, we perform a statistical correction of \(\sqrt{3}/8+\pi/6=0.740\)
to account for photometric rapid rotators scattering to low
\vsini{}. Applying this correction exacerbates the disagreement between
spectroscopic and photometric rapid rotator rates because the inferred range of
rapid rotators increases to 35-67\% for binaries.

The cumulative \vsini{} distribution of our sample is shown 
in \cref{fig:detection_fraction}, with each bin corresponding to the
fraction of targets with APOGEE \vsini{} less than the given
\vsini{}. Error bars denote  binomial 1-\(\sigma\) confidence 
intervals based on selecting the number of rapid rotators from the full 
sample.  As such, the rapid rotator fraction is the complement of that
value. 

As a result, we find that the fraction of
spectroscopic rapid rotators is significantly larger than the fraction
of spectroscopic rapid rotators by a factor of 4-13. 
Accounting for
inclination effects makes the discrepancy even worse to a 4-\(\sigma\)
level. This discrepenacy is highly robust to the choice of
\vsini{} detection limit. Unlike  
the case with the asteroseismic targets, the fraction of spectroscopic rapid
rotators is greater than the fraction of photometric rapid
rotators at a highly-significant level, which is exacerbated afer taking the
inclination correction into account.

We also checked the spectroscopic rapid rotator fraction of the 
\citet{McQuillan14} nondetections for the single and binary sequences. We 
found that the spectroscopic rapid rotator fraction is significantly
lower in the nondetections than the overlap sample for the binaries, but are 
inconsistent with zero for both the binary and single stars. 
A non-zero rapid rotator fraction is surprising because the nondetection
sample is expected to be comprised of slow-rotating inactive stars and 
high-inclination spotted stars, both of which are incompatible with low 
\vsini{} values. 

\begin{figure*}

  \caption{\emph{Left:} APOGEE \vsini{} plotted against equatorial

  in dark blue while the marginal \vsini{} detections are shown in light
  blue. The solid and dashed lines correspond to values where \(\sin i =
  1, 0.5\), respectively. The hatched area represents the forbidden
  region where \(\sin i > 1\). \emph{Middle:} Symbols are similar to left

  projected such that the \citet{McQuillan14} period is plotted against the
  period inferred from the \vsini{} and radius.\label{fig:rot}}
\end{figure*}

To further investigate the discrepancy in rapid rotation rates, we
performed a point-by-point comparison of rotation measures for these 
targets is shown in the bottom panels of
\cref{fig:rot}. The comparison between \vsini{} and equatorial velocity shows
that the discrepancy between \vsini{} and photometric period is not due to slight
but coherent model errors, or a few discrepant points. Unlike with the
asteroseismic sample, all but one of the targets
lie in the forbidden \(\sin i > 1\) region with both the confident and
marginal detections affected. This is indicative of a systematic
bias where periods are consistently (and sometimes drastically) too slow to be
consistent with \vsini{}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\gvs{Under Construction}

Our analysis by combining APOGEE and \Gaia{} data shows that rapid
rotation is not a single-star phenomenon. This is an indication that
consideration of multiplicity is important before applying gyrochronological
relations to the \Kepler{} field. Confirmation of photometric excesses for 
both photometric and spectroscopic rapid rotators indicates that, at least
for some systems, their rapid rotation is physical.

There are two main mechanisms to explain why objects on the photometric
sequence should produce rapid rotation. One is that the system contains
a binary where the two components undergo tidal interactions. These
systems ought to have orbital periods less than 7 day
\citep{Raghavan10}. Since these are short-period systems, they're predicted 
to be strongly biased toward having equal-mass components
\citep{Bate02}. The high rate of photometric excess among the rapid
rotators supports that view. Another explanation for rapid rotation
among objects with photometric excesses is that those systems are
interaction products, and were spun up by mass-transfer. This
explanation is much more likely for the objects above the photometric
binary sequence, which may be thermally unstable.

Our result that rapid rotators tend to be binaries supports the
predictions of efforts attempting to detect stellar multiplicity from
spectra \citep{ElBadry18}. \citet{ElBadry18} analyzed all APOGEE spectra
from DR13 before \Gaia{} parallaxes were available, including a
significant fraction of this sample. They
reported that 18/19 rapid rotators on the photometric sequence and 2/2 on 
the main sequence show signs of composite spectra based on their
data-driven classification. While \citet{ElBadry18} successfully inferred the
high binary fraction of our sample, the fact that they classified both objects
with low photometric excesses as having composite spectra suggests that 
rapid rotation may be degenerately classified with a composite spectrum
in their machine-learning method.

Our other major result is that spectroscopic measures of rapid rotation 
disagree significantly with photometric measures. In particular,
photometric rapid rotation is generally confirmed by spectroscopic rapid
rotation, but not vice versa. This suggests two
possibilities: the \citet{McQuillan14} method misclassifies rapid
rotators as slow, or that the APOGEE \vsini{} have significant false
positives.

The observation that this discrepancy exists for cool dwarfs and not
asteroseismic stars is a significant clue to its origin. It indicates 
that the discrepancy is only significant for certain parts of the HR diagram. 
The main differences between the two are temperatures, with asteroseismic 
targets being significantly warmer than our cool sample, and evolutionary 
state, where asteroseismic targets are subgiants and the cool sample consists 
of dwarfs.

The discrepancy between spectroscopic and 
photometric rapid rotation fractions can be seen in other published work as well. 
\citet{Nielsen13} compared their measurements of \Kepler{} rotation periods to
an amalgamation of \vsini{} from various clusters. They found that the
\vsini{} distribution was consistent with the period distribution for spectral
types F--K, and then the periods dropped below the \vsini{} measurements for
K--M (top panel of their Fig. 2). They ascribe the discrepancy in the cool
stars to a shift in the \Kepler{} age distribution between the hot and cool
stars; however, we consider that the photometric periods may degrade for
binaries.  Additional confirmation occured through the APOGEE M-dwarf rotation
program \citep{Gilhool18}, which surveyed a color- and proper-motion-selected 
sample of nearby M-dwarfs. Unlike in this work, the \vsini{} were measured 
directly through the spectra as opposed to through ASPCAP\@. For the \Teff{} range that
overlaps with \citet{McQuillan14} \(4000 \textrm{ K } > \Teff > 3200\) K, they 
find that 5.8\% of their targets have \(\vsini > 8 \kms\). This is 
significantly greater than our photometric rapid rotator fraction at 8 \kms{} 
of 2.5\%. 

Confusion in the \Kepler{} pixels is one potential explanation for the
discrepancy. Because the \Kepler{} pixels are relatively large (4\arcsec), a 
bright, hot primary star sharing a pixel with a fainter, spottier companion 
contributing the photometric modulation in the
\Kepler{} light curve would explain the observed contradiction between
\vsini{} and rotation period. Despite this setup being unlikely, because for 
stars cooler than the Kraft break, rotation and activity are highly 
correlated, we check for bright companions
within the \Kepler{} pixel using the \Kepler{} field high-resolution UKIRT
J-band images introduced in Section~\ref{sec:vsini_check}. We did not find a 
correlation between that the presence of a bright companion and the magnitude 
of the offset, indicating that confusion is likely not the main source of the 
problem.

The presence of high \vsini{} objects in the period nondetections is
further evidence of a systematic discrepancy. Previous studies have found an 
inverse correlation between photometric variability and Rossby number (defined 
as \(R_o = P / \tau_{cz}\), where \(P\) is the rotation period and 
\(\tau_{cz}\) is the color-dependent convective overturn timescale) 
\citep{Messina01,Hartman09}. Since activity is also inversely
proportional to the Rossby number, this predicts that the stars without
spots should also be rotating slowly, which is not consistent with high
\vsini{}. As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:vsini_check}, inclination may
also lead to period nondetections, but the low-inclination systems which
don't show starspot modulation would also be expected to show low
\vsini{}. Therefore, we conclude that the existence of 
stars with low Rossby number and low photometric variability may either 
indicate that additional factors determine photometric variability 
aside from the Rossby number, or that \citet{McQuillan14} is not detecting 
rapid rotation in genuine, spotted rapid rotators.

One other potential explanation for the mismatch between the photometric
rotation periods and \vsini{} is the presence of SB2s with a special geometry
where the two components are offset enough that their spectral features
overlap, yet not offset enough for the two components to be visually
distinguished. Binarity would also explain the difference in behaviors
between the cool dwarfs and asteroseismic targets; stars with close, but
not identical masses would have similar luminosities on the main
sequence, but significantly different luminosities when the primary
becomes a subgiant, reducing the impact of the secondary on
\vsini{}. However, the main drawback of this explanation is that
binaries in this configuration should be rarer than observed rate of
rapid rotators. These contaminants will be dominated by systems whose
orbital velocity is in a narrow range of near half the instrumental
resolution, which should be less than 1\% of the sample. However, we are
not able to discount this explanation for the large number of
spectroscopic rapid rotators.

Lastly, the explanation we propose for the behavior of rapid rotatiors is that 
the large-scale period-finding algorithms are yielding
spurious results on short-period tidally-coupled active systems. The
reliability of these algorithms have not been tested for systems that
have a superposition of spot-modulation signals at equal or near-equal
periods with a phase offset. 

While we have two potential explanations for the discrepancy between the
photometric and spectroscopic rapid rotator rate, our currently
available data is unable to distinguish between the two. The most
effective way to break the degeneracy will be to follow-up the high
\vsini{} objects with spectroscopy at higher resolution than APOGEE\@. If
the line broadening is truly due to blending, the the two components
should easily separate out. If not, then we can conclude that the
spectroscopic rapid rotation is real, and the line is intrisically
broadened.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\gvs{Under Construction}

We analyzed the APOGEE sample of 368 cool dwarfs in the \Kepler{} field with 
rotation periods in \citet{McQuillan14} using DSEP-derived stellar radii. One
of the first results we found was that 86\% of the rapid rotators are
photometric binaries, indicating that rapid rotation is largely the product of
binary evolution. For the binaries in particular, we
found a substantial discrepancy between the two measures of rotation
among the high \vsini{} targets, with the spectroscopic rapid
rotator rate being 4--13 times the photometric rapid rotator rate. 

A point-by-point analysis of the 49 rapid rotators in our sample revealed that
rotational periods for the entire sample are universally too long to match the 
\vsini{}. This finding implies severe systematic uncertainties in either the
measurement of \vsini{} or rotation period. We suggest several possible ways 
to investigate the underlying causes.

The best way to determine how much of the discrepancy is due to blending of
spectral line is to follow-up with high-resolution spectroscopy beyond the
resolution of APOGEE\@. Whether or not the broadening is found to be real, or to
be composed of multiple components will help determine the true rapid
rotator rate in the \Kepler{} field.

Systematic uncertainties in period determinations will be significantly more
difficult to investigate. One start may be to perform a targeted period search
at short periods for the rapid rotators where the blind search returned a long
period. The presence of a short-period signal would confirm that the
spectroscopic rapid rotators are physical. Another direction would be to use an
algorithm which can successfully identify multiple periods, as has been used
for the K2 cluster campaign \citep{Rebull16,Rebull17}. If multiple signals are
present in a light curve, these methods may be able to pick both as opposed to
favoring one over the other.

Regardless of the source of the inconsistency, we caution readers about 
interpreting large datasets of rotation in the \Kepler{} field without 
independent confirmation until the source of this inconsistency is found.
