    The \Kepler{} fields have yielded a large data set of photometric rotation
    periods, which when combined with \Gaia{} parallaxes and APOGEE
    high-resolution spectroscopic data for over 4,000 dwarfs and subgiants, 
    can reveal significant insights into the evolution of rotation in stars, 
    We report on spectroscopic measurements of stellar rotation from APOGEE in an
    easily-characterized sample of over 600 cool dwarfs and subgiants in the
    \Kepler{} field. Our data are in good agreement with literature values for
    asteroseismic and Pleiades targets, with a detection threshold between 7 
    and 10 \kms. We find a rapid rotation fraction among the photometric
    binaries of \(\sim 25\%\). When comparing spectroscopic to photometric 
    rotation rates, we find that the photometric rapid rotator 
    fraction is lower than the spectroscopic fraction by a factor of 4--5, yet
    still greatly enhanced in the photometric binaries. A point-by-point 
    analysis reveals that almost all targets have rotation periods too long 
    for their measured \vsini{}. We find these results suggest that either 
    significant contamination of field \vsini{} measurements by photometric 
    binaries with blended spectral features, or current large-scale 
    photometric surveys may mis-characterize or exclude 
    cool rapid rotators in the field.

\section{Introduction}

One of the significant results from the \Kepler{} satellite has been the
determination of rotational periods for a large sample of old, field stars
\citep{Basri11,Affer12,Nielsen13,Reinhold13,McQuillan14,Garcia14}.
These rotation rates are expected to be extremely useful to deriving a field
gyrochronology, which can better characterize the ages of
\Kepler{} stars, and hence better understand discovered planets.


Current attempts to synthesize rotation information with known ages of
asteroseismic targets in the \Kepler{} field have consistently found a dearth
of long-period (\(P_{rot} \sim 60\) day) rotators \citep{Angus15,vanSaders16}. 
Forward modeling of the \Kepler{} field using existing rotation-activity
relations and estimates of the \Kepler{} selection function further confirm 
that models significantly under-predict the number of (\(P_{rot} > 30\) day) 
rotators in the \Kepler{} field \citep{vanSaders18}. Proposed solutions for 
relieving this tension have been modifying the activity relation in models to 
drop precipitously at a particular rotation threshold, or modifyling angular 
momentum loss to shut off at \(P_{rot} \sim 30\) days \citep{vanSaders18}.

Rotation has proven to be puzzling on the rapid end as well. The \Kepler{} 
field was chosen to point outside of the plane of the galactic
disk, biasing the field toward older stars.  Despite the old age of the
field, there is still a population of rapid rotators at the level of 10\% 
which have rotation rates significantly higher than expected from
existing gyrochronological relations \citep{McQuillan14}. Possible explanation
for these rapid rotators are a truly young stellar population, a background of
tidally-synchronized binaries, contamination of background pulsators in the
\Kepler{} PSF, or confusion with rapidly-rotating subgiants \citep{vanSaders13}. 

A substantial population of young stars would be a significant change in our
view of the \Kepler{} field. Already, more detailed models of the
\Kepler{} field are indicating that there may be more young stars than
previously thought \citep{vanSaders18}. In addition, a widespread presence of
Lithium may indicate that planet-hosting stars may be more youthful than
expected \citep{Berger18a}. Rotation will provde an independent view into youth
in the \Kepler{} field.

In addition to youth, the discovery of a significant population of
tidally-synchronized binaries would also be an exciting find.
Tidally-synchronized binaries do not form through the typical fragmentation
process, but rather from dynamical interactions on the pre-main sequence
\citep{Bate02}. However, tidally-synchronized binaries have been difficult to
characterize because they are rare \citep{Patience02,Raghavan10}. A substantial
number of new tidally-synchronized systems would be extremely useful for
characterizing the population.

Previous studies have succesfully combined rotational periods and \vsini{} 
to study systematics in the radii of pre-main sequence stars
\citep{Rhode01,Jeffries07}, the inclination distribution in clusters 
\citep{Jackson10}, and the inference of radius inflation
\citep{Jackson09,Jackson16,Jackson18}. All of these studies were done for
clusters, where large numbers of spectra could be observed and analyzed under 
the assumption of uniform distances and composition. The availability of
rotation periods and \vsini{} for field stars will be instrumental in 
illuminating other phenomena such as gyrochronology 
\citep{Barnes07,Mamajek08,Angus15}, radius inflation \citep{Jackson18}, and 
rotation on the subgiant branch \citep{vanSaders13}.

In this paper, we study the rotation distribution of \Kepler{} targets as
seen from APOGEE \vsini{}s and compare to published periods. In 
Section~\ref{sec:sample} we describe the
selection of cool dwarfs to ensure a reliable comparison between
\vsini{} and period. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we describe the reliability
of the quantities we need in order to compare rotation via \vsini{} and
photometric modulation. We also demonstrate our methodology works with the 
APOKASC asteroseismic sample. In Section~\ref{sec:fraction}, we compare the 
rapid rotator fraction from photometric studies to that found using APOGEE 
spectra. In Section~\ref{sec:results}, we compare the two measures of 
rotation on a point-by-point basis and postulate reasons for disagreement. 
Lastly, we summarize our findings and discuss future efforts in 
Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Sample Selection}
\label{sec:sample}

\begin{figure*}

    \caption{\emph{Left:} Stellar properties of the full APOKASC 
    asteroseismic dwarf/subgiant control sample. The black points mark
    K-band absolute magnitudes for the full control sample. Green stars mark
    the subsample showing oscillations. Rapid rotators with 
    \(\vsini > 10 \kms\) are denoted as dark blue circles, while stars with 
    marginally detected rotation \(7 \kms < \vsini < 10 \kms\) are denoted 
    with light blue circles. Objects classified as showing double-lines in 
    their APOGEE spectra are labeled as salmon stars.
    \emph{Right:} The full cool dwarf sample as measured with APOGEE stellar

    with dwarfs, subgiants, and giants marked as teal, purple, and mustard

    Objects showing rapid (\(P_{rot} < 3 \) day) photometric rotation are 
    indicated with purple diamonds. Objects showing double-lined APOGEE 
    spectra are indicated as salmon stars. The dotted vertical 
    line indicates the \(\Teff = 5450\) K boundary.\label{fig:sample}}
\end{figure*}

The central dataset for this analysis is from the Apache Point Observatory 
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) \citep{Blanton17,Majewski17}. The
APOGEE instrument is a high-resolution (\(R \sim 22,000\)) multi-fiber 
near-infrared spectrograph \citep{Wilson10}, mounted on the SDSS 2.5-meter 
telescope at Apache Point Observatory \citep{Gunn06}. Observations for each
target are automatically reduced and combined as part of the APOGEE data 
pipeline \citep{Nidever15}. Stellar parameters are then determined from the 
combined spectra through the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundance 
Pipeline (ASPCAP), which outputs \Teff{}, \logg{}, \([M/H]\), \vsini{}, as 
well as 15 additional chemical abundances \citep{GarciaPerez16}.

Under several major observing programs, APOGEE systematically observed over 
5,000 dwarfs and subgiants in the \Kepler{} field. Around half were
observed as part of a program to determine false positives for
asteroseismic
detections\footnote{\url{http://www.sdss.org/dr14/irspec/targets/\#AsteroseismicTargets}}. 
They were part of a magnitude-limited sample
selected according to 6500 K \(> \Teff > 5000\) K and \(\logg > 3.5\)
according to parameters derived by \citet{Huber14} \citep{Zasowski17}
which we call the hot sample. An additional 
1000 stars, which we call the cool dwarf sample, with \(\Teff < 5500\) K and 
\(\logg > 4.0\) as determined by \citet{Pinsonneault12} and \citet{Brown11},
and \(7 \textrm{ mag } < H < 11 \textrm{ mag}\) were also 
observed\footnote{\url{http://www.sdss.org/dr14/algorithms/ancillary/apogee/kepler_dwarfs/}}. 
Eclipsing
binaries\footnote{\url{http://www.sdss.org/dr14/irspec/targets/\#EclipsingBinaries}} 
and transiting planet host 
candidates\footnote{\url{http://www.sdss.org/dr14/irspec/targets/\#KeplerObjectsofInterest}} 
were also observed 
by APOGEE in the \Kepler{} field, but with more complex selection functions, 
so we exclude them from this analysis.

\subsection{Stellar Parameters}

All objects observed by APOGEE have stellar parameters \Teff{} and
[Fe/H] determined by ASPCAP, which fits synthetic stellar atmosphere
models to the observed H-band spectra on a 6-dimensional grid. The
effective temperatures outputted from ASPCAP are then calibrated to the
\citep{GonzalezHernandez09} photometric temperature scale using a
metallicity-dependent correction \citep{Holtzmann18}. After the
calibration, comparisons to observations in open clusters yield a
typical RMS of 100 K around solar-metallicity. While the calibration
relations are significantly less constrained at \([M/H] < -1\), the
finding that the metallicity of the \Kepler{} field is on-average solar
makes these systematic uncertainties largely irrelevant.

As is apparent in the right panel of \cref{fig:sample}, the hot 
(\(\Teff > 5500 K\)) star regime is difficult to characterize due to 
significant confusion between main-sequence age evolution,
photometric binaries, and subgiants crossing the Hertzsprung Gap.
A proper analysis with detailed modeling of the complex radius uncertainties 
will be necessary to interpret the rotation for these stars. We chose instead to study measures of
stellar rotation in the cool dwarf regime, where
slow stellar evolution allows the radii to be easily characterizable through
stellar models, and the cool subgiants, photometric binaries, and main-sequence
stars are more easily separated.

\subsection{Cool Dwarfs}

For our base sample, we chose objects observed as part of the APOGEE cool
dwarf ancillary targeting program.  Most of these objects were observed in 
the first phase of APOGEE under the
\textit{APOGEE\_KEPLER\_COOLDWARF} targeting flag. The remainder of
the sample was targeted in APOGEE-2 under the \textit{APOGEE2\_SEISMO\_DWARF}
flag. We applied the original selection criteria to the new sample in order get
the updated target list. As of the DR14, the program has been \(\sim 85\)\% 
completed with 1028 objects having been observed. 

The main quality cut performed was based on APOGEE stellar parameter fits.
Depending on the reduced chi-square of the atmosphere model fit, or
disagreement with photometric temperature relations, the ASPCAP pipeline
may trigger a flag indicating that the ouputted parameters may not be
reliable. We categorized our sample into those with \STARBAD, \STARWARN,
\VSINIWARN{}, and no flag enabled to check the quality of the fits. We
visually inspected the spectra for a representative sample of these
quality classes. 
Visual inspection of targets with the \STARBAD{} flag showed that they are 
largely the result of poor subtraction or normalization of the spectrum in the
pipeline, or are due to poor model fits on the cool (\(\Teff < 4250\) K) end. 
123 targets in the full sample have the \STARBAD{} quality flag enabled. 
Targets labeled as \STARWARN{} are a significantly larger fraction of the 
sample. We found that the model fits reasonably resembled the target spectra. 
For this reason, we retained targets with the \STARWARN{} flag enabled. The 
same occured for targets with the \VSINIWARN{} flags.

We also found that stars hotter than
\(\Teff = 5450\) K were significantly more difficult to characterize due to
rapid age evolution and overlap with subgiants. Because only a small 
fraction of our sample has \(\Teff > 5450\) K, we removed targets hotter
than cut. The effect of the cut on the sample is shown in \cref{fig:sample}.

We supplement the stellar parameters provided by APOGEE with distances and radii from the 
\Gaia{} satellite \citep{Gaia16} Data Release 2 \citep{Gaia18}, reanalyzed 
using the methodology of \citet{Huber14} \citep{Berger18b}. In summary, this
procedure derived new stellar parameters based on priors informed from stellar
parameters in the Kepler Stellar Parameter Pipeline DR25 \citep{Mathur17}.
These parameters were ultimately derived from KIC photometry \citep{Brown11},
with more precise inputs where applicable.

We calculated K-band absolute magnitudes using distances, derived in
\citet{Berger18b} and 2MASS K-band magnitudes \citep{Skrutskie06}. K-band 
apparent magnitudes were
available for all but 10 stars in our sample, which had K-band upper limits due
to blending uncertainties. Those objects are denoted as upper limits. Because
the only quantities available characterizing the distance uncertainty are the
mode and 1-\(\sigma\) confidence intervals, we propagate asymmetric
uncertainties by adding the K-band photometric error separately to the upper
and lower distance uncertainties in quadrature. As seen in \cref{fig:sample},
the error bars are comparable to the size of the points.

We classified our sample into dwarfs, subgiants, and giants according to
the prescription given in \citep{Berger18b}, which used cuts informed by
stellar models predictions of the terminal-age main sequence and the base of
the red giant branch. We do not use their criteria to split between
main-sequence dwarfs and photometric binaries, and instead incorporate APOGEE
metallicities as described in Section~\ref{sec:binarity}. The classifications 
are illustrated
in the left panel of \cref{fig:sample}. These cuts yield a sample with 86
subgiants, 445 dwarfs, and 152 photometric binaries.

We also inspected the spectra for every target with \(\vsini > 7 \kms\)
for the presence of double lines. Most targets showed obvious cases of ASPCAP 
fitting a single broad line over two separate narrow features, other cases 
only revealed the second component in individual visit spectra. The targets 
showing double-lined spectra were excluded from the analysis because of
the unreliability of the catalog \vsini{}. Objects classified as having
double-lined spectra are shown in \cref{fig:sample}. More sophisticated future
analyses may be able to disentangle \vsini{} measurements from each component 
\citep{ElBadry18}. There are
also cases where the observed spectra show high RV variability
without a visible second component. We include these cases in our sample
because the measured \vsini{} shouldn't be impacted.

To control for differences between the photometric and spectroscopic sample,
we performed the bulk of our analysis on the subset of 408 objects
observed in APOGEE which also have period detections in \citet{McQuillan14}.
An additional 205 did not have significant periods in \citet{McQuillan14}, and
will be analyzed separately. The remaining 44 targets were excluded by
the original sample selection in \citet{McQuillan14}. 




\subsection{Asteroseismic Targets}

One of the most well-characterized subsets of the \Kepler{} field is the
APOKASC asteroseismic sample. The APOKASC asteroseismic dwarf and subgiant 
sample consists of 426 targets which presented solar-type oscillations in 
\Kepler{} short-cadence data \citep{Chaplin11}, and were observed in APOGEE DR13
\citep{Majewski17}. Using asteroseismic scaling relations, the radii
for these objects can be determined to an accuracy of around 3\%
\citep{Serenelli17}. Because of their excellent parametrization, we treat the
asteroseismic catalog as a control sample, where stellar properties are
well-known. It should be noted that subgiants are overrepresented in
the asteroseismic population because the amplitude of solar-type oscillations 
increases as stars evolve. The locations of the asteroseismic targets in an HR
diagram using both the asteroseismic and spectroscopic \logg{} is shown in 
the left panel of \cref{fig:sample}.

The selection of the asteroseismic targets mirrors that of the cool dwarf
sample. From the 426 asteroseismic dwarfs from the APOKASC v4.2.4 catalog, we 
removed three objects with the STAR\_BAD flag, while including 51 objects with 
the \STARWARN{} and 46 objects with the \VSINIWARN{} flags after visual 
inspection. All targets with \(\vsini \ge 7\) \kms{} were visually
inspected for double-lined spectra leading to four being excluded. 91 of 
the remaining stars have period detections in \citet{McQuillan14}, 240 were 
period nondetections, and 88 did not fall under the selection criteria in 
\citet{McQuillan14}. 

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In order to consistently compare different measures of rotation, we require 
reliable \vsini{}, rotational periods, and stellar radii. We perform validation
exercises to make sure that the quantities adopted for these three measures are 
reasonable.


\subsection{\vsini{} validation}
\label{sec:vsini_check}

\begin{figure*}

    \vsini{} and equatorial \(v_{eq} = \frac{2\pi R}{P}\) for the

    \vsini{} detections while light blue points correspond to marginal
    \vsini{} detections. The lines corresponding to \(\sin i = 1\) and
    \(\sin i = 0.5\) are denoted as solid and dashed lines. The hatch
    marks denote the forbidden region where \(\sin i > 1\).\label{fig:comps}}
\end{figure*}


The ability to measure \vsini{} is relatively new to the ASPCAP pipeline, only
being included since DR13. As a result, catalog \vsini{}s have not been 
extensively vetted and verified. APOGEE does not provide a reasonable
detection limit, or an estimate on the uncertainty of \vsini{}. We
attempt to characterize the APOGEE \vsini{} measurements ourselves
by comparing to literature \vsini{} for targets studied with high-resolution 
optical spectroscopy. Our method of determining the detection limit and
uncertainty for \vsini{} is similar to that performed in
\citet{Tayar15}.

One large collection of \vsini{}s comes from an effort to study the
\Kepler{} asteroseismic targets \citep{Bruntt12}. \citet{Bruntt12} analyzed 
spectra of 93 solar-type asteroseismic targets using two R=80,000 spectrographs 
on the 3.6-meter Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope and 2-m Bernard Lyot
Telescope. While uncertainties are not quoted in \citet{Bruntt12},
previous analyses have determined \vsini{} uncertainties of about 0.6
\kms \citep{Bruntt10a,Bruntt10b}.

A comparison between the APOGEE and \citet{Bruntt12} targets is shown in
\cref{fig:comps}. Not shown are six
objects which the ASPCAP pipeline classified as giants, and omitted
\vsini{}. The \citet{Bruntt12} \vsini{} is less than 5 \kms{} for all of 
these objects, making them consistent with 
nondetections.  In order to characterize the APOGEE \vsini{}s, we model the 
two datasets as being linearly related above a specific detection threshold 
with a constant fractional uncertainty. The sample shows a 
discontinuity in the scatter at APOGEE \(\vsini=7\kms\), which we 
interpret as the detection limit of APOGEE, above which \vsini{} yields a 
valid stellar rotation measurement. Since the \citet{Bruntt12} errors are
significantly smaller than the expected APOGEE errors, we performed a simple 
linear regression for all targets with APOGEE \vsini{} above the detection 
limit to obtain the relationship. We got that the two datasets have slopes
consistent with one, but with a significant zero-point offset of 9\%,
with the APOGEE \vsini{} being lower than the \citet{Bruntt12}
\vsini{}. We estimated the measurement error by calculating the mean squared 
error of the residuals, yielding a 13\% uncertainty which we adopted as the 
uncertainty in APOGEE \vsini{}.

There is little overlap between our cool dwarfs and the 
\citet{Bruntt12} sample because the asteroseismic targets tend to be massive and 
highly populated by subgiants. In order to perform a check with a more
representative sample, we compared APOGEE \vsini{}s with  
measurements of cool dwarfs in the Pleiades \citep{Stauffer87}. Because
Pleiades dwarfs are significantly younger than those in the field,
they rotate much more rapidly. This is advantageous because their 
wide distribution of \vsini{}s allows for a wide range of \vsini{}s to be 
validated. The \citet{Stauffer87} survey reported a detection limit of
10 \kms, which should lie below our reported limit. We plot the overlap 
sample with \citet{Stauffer87} in \cref{fig:comps}.  Unlike the asteroseismic 
targets, the Pleiades targets experience a discontinuity in scatter at 
\(\vsini = 10 \kms\).  Nonetheless, the errors and fit seem consistent above 
the detection threshold.

The difference in detection limit between the Pleiades and asteroseismic sample
indicates that the ability to measure \vsini{} changes is a function of stellar
parameters. In order to ensure that our results are robust to the choice of
detection threshold, we
perform our analyses with different detection thresholds to show that any
results are persistent.

\subsection{Period Validation}

The validation of rotational periods in the \Kepler{} field has been a
well-studied problem. There have been multiple different approaches to
measuring rotation periods \citep{Reinhold13,Nielsen13,McQuillan14,Garcia14}.
\citet{McQuillan14} compared their periods to those of previous work
\citep{Reinhold13,Nielsen13}. The overlap samples with
\citet{Reinhold13} and \citet{Nielsen13} are 20,009 and 10,381,
respectively. Within these overlaps, the different methods get
consistent periods 65\% and 94\% of the time, respectively, and detect
aliased periods 7\% and 2\% of the time. The large discrepancy with
\citet{Reinhold13} is attributed to their only using data for one
\Kepler{}<++> quarter, in contrast to the 12 quarter required by 
\citet{McQuillan14}.

The completeness of \citet{McQuillan14}, on the other hand, is fairly
good. For targets which had periods reported by \citet{Reinhold13},
\citet{McQuillan14} reported missing 1503 of them, leading to a detection
discrepancy of 7\%. The discrepancy with \citet{Nielsen13} is 2\%.

A comprehensive, hounds-and-hares exercise analyzed the performance of
several different periodograms on injected stellar rotation signals 
\citep{Aigrain15}. The Autocorrelation Function method used in 
\citet{McQuillan14} was found to have a 100\% detection rate on noisy
data while still maintaining around 70 percent reliability in correctly
identifying an injected signal. In contrast, \citet{Nielsen13} has a low
detection fraction of 16\%, but 100\% reliability \citep{Aigrain15}.
\citet{Aigrain15} identifies the most prominent failure modes: detection
of the spot lifetime instead of the rotational period, and detection of
the stellar cycle period for stars with short cycles.

Despite the comprehensiveness of the hounds-and-hares exercise, it has
several limitations. The light curves are idealized with a single
stellar signal, and do not take into account blended signals with
multiple potential periodicities. The injected signals also did not
include highly active stars and stars with persistent spots, which are
expected to be overrepresented among rapid rotators. It was also
difficult to compare the performances of each algorithm specifically in
the rapidly-rotating regime without the underlying data.

\subsection{Comparison for Asteroseismic Targets}
\label{sec:astero}

Before attempting to compare \vsini{} and rotation period for our sample, we 
first validated our comparison methodology on asteroseismic targets. We 
compared the measured \vsini{} to the equatorial velocity 
derived from the rotational periods and the asteroseismic radii. The resulting 
comparison is shown in the right panel of \cref{fig:comps}. We distinguished 
between confident \vsini{} detections with \(\vsini > 10 \kms\), and marginal 
detections with \(7 \kms < \vsini < 10 \kms\). Of the confident and
marginal detections, two and three, respectively, have non-physical solutions 
with \(\sin i > 1\). 

The marginal detections with unphysical \vsini{} (KIC 8677016, 8952800, 10518551) 
have \vsini{} values close to the detection threshold. Because the errors of 
marginal \vsini{} detections are complicated, it may be possible that these 
are outliers. 

Of the confident detections with unphysical \vsini{}, KIC 3223000 has a
\vsini{} which is slightly above the predicted equatorial velocity. It
is a 1.7-\(\sigma\) difference based on the \vsini{} uncertainty, which
may be consistent as a statistical fluctuation. It can also
be explained by the 4.9 day measured rotation period actually being a 
half-period detection alias, implying a twice as large equatorial velocity. 

The final outlier, KIC 9908400, is so significantly off of the relation
that it can not be explained by either uncertainties or aliasing. However,
it may be adequately explained by contamination of the \Kepler{} PSF\@. 
High-resolution J-band imaging of the \Kepler{} field, provided by the United
Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) reveals a bright, nearby blended companion.
Additionally, KIC 9908400 has a high \Teff{} placing it above the Kraft
break, where convective envelopes are thin;
making spots unlikely. Photometric variation originating from the fainter 
star would explain the mismatch in \vsini{} and rotation period.

\subsection{Photometric Binaries}
\label{sec:binarity}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{binarity}
    \caption{Magnitude excess of targets observed in the full dwarf sample
    above DSEP models at matching model \Teff{} and [Fe/H]. The solid line
denotes the cut between single stars on the bottom and photometric binaries
above. The larger cutoff at higher temperature results from the faster age
evolution for hotter stars.}
    \label{fig:binarity}
\end{figure}

\Gaia{} parallaxes provide a valuable way of separating photometric binaries
from the rest of the sample. As can be seen in \cref{fig:sample}, photometric
binaries clearly stand out approximately 0.75 mag above the main sequence, a
level significantly higher than the typical uncertainty in absolute magnitude. 
We attempt to separate the photometric binaries from the main sequence by
comparing the observed K-band absolute magnitude to that predicted by 
isochrones from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program (DSEP) 
\citep{Dotter07,Dotter08}.

The primary uncertainties in the predicted isochrone are the metallicity and
age. The availability of APOGEE metallicities throughout the sample provides
significantly improved constraints on whether targets are photometric binaries
or not. For derive K-band absolute magnitudes by inputting APOGEE
\Teff{} and [Fe/H] values, and assuming solar alpha abundance on a grid of
models with metallicity differences of \([Fe/H] = 0.05\). The resulting offset
between observed and calculated K-band absolute magnitude is shown in 
\cref{fig:binarity}. 

The effect of age can be seen as the temperature-dependent scatter on the main
sequence. Based on DSEP-modelled K-band luminosity differences between 1--10
Gyr, the scatter due to age ignorance can be up to 0.25 mag at \(\Teff \sim
5500\) K, down to 0.05 mag at \(\Teff \sim 4000 \) K. For this reason, we adopt
a more conservative cut at the hot end to avoid misclassifiying evolved single
stars, with a more generous cut at the cool end, where age effects are less
significant.


\subsection{Stellar Radii Validation}
\label{sec:radii}

The main attraction of cool stars is that their slow age evolution
constrains the possible range of stellar radii. We quantified this uncertainty 
using DSEP isochrones to estimate the impact of age 
ignorance on the radius uncertainties. We defined our uncertainty as the 
difference in radius between stars of similar \Teff{}, with ages between 1 
and 10 Gyr. For solar metallicity models, the uncertainty in radius due to 
age is about 8.5\% at the hot end of our sample, and decreases sharply with 
\Teff. 

Error bars for the individual stellar radii follow the same convention as
above, except are based on the individual star's temperature and metallicity 
at 1 Gyr and 10 Gyr. Because the ``global'' APOGEE uncertainty for [Fe/H] is 
around 0.05 dex, we measured radii on an [Fe/H] grid spaced by 0.05 dex,
similar as done in Section~\ref{sec:binarity}.

A potentially larger systematic uncertainty than the impact of age is the 
misclassification of subgiants as dwarfs. This uncertainty would certainly lead to underestimating
the stellar radii of dwarfs by several factors. However, due to the exquisite
precision of the distances from \citep{Berger18b}, as demonstrated in
\cref{fig:sample}, it's highly unlikely that we will have contamination from
incorrectly-characterized subgiants. 

\section{Rapid Rotator Fractions}
\label{sec:fraction}

    \caption{Cumulative distribution function of \vsini{} for the single and
        binary samples for spectroscopic and photometric rotation data. The 
        rapid rotator fraction at a given \vsini{} threshold
    would be one minus the value of the cumulative distribution function
    at that \vsini{} value. Solid lines denote the cumulative

    cumulative distribution function of \vsini{} for the subsample without

    1-\(\sigma\) binomial confidence levels.\label{fig:detection_fraction}}
\end{figure}

The broadest check to determine agreement between the spectroscopic
and photometric rotation data is comparing the rapid rotator fraction
in both datasets. We defined spectroscopic rapid rotators in this exercise as 
stars having \vsini{} above the detection threshold of the APOGEE 
spectrograph. As mentioned in 
Section~\ref{sec:vsini_check}, APOGEE \vsini{} measurements have not been fully
characterized, with a detection threshold possibl at 7 \kms{}, but definitely
beneath 10 \kms{}. We report rapid rotator fractions over multiple detection 
thresholds to ensure the robustness of our results.

We report the rapid rotator fractions for the single star and photometric
binary sequence. The cumulative \vsini{} distribution of our sample is shown 
in \cref{fig:detection_fraction}, with each bin corresponding to the
fraction of targets with APOGEE \vsini{} less than the given
\vsini{}. Error bars denote  binomial 1-\(\sigma\) confidence 
intervals based on selecting the number of rapid rotators from the full 
sample.  As such, the rapid rotator fraction is the complement of that
value. 

For the photometric binaries, the rapid rotator fraction ranges from 50\% for a
detection threshold of 6 \kms, to 26\% for a detection threshold of 12 \kms.
Meanwhile, the single-star rapid rotator rate ranges from 2.5\% at a detection
limit of 6 \kms and 0.5\% at 12 \kms.

In order to obtain a photometric rapid rotator fraction corresponding to
a \vsini{} detection limit, we transformed the \vsini{} threshold into period 
space. The relationship between rotational period and equatorial velocity is 
given by the relation 
\begin{displaymath}
    v_{eq} = \frac{2 \pi R}{P} 
\end{displaymath}
where \(R\) is the equatorial radius and \(P\) is the rotation period. As we
noted in Section~\ref{sec:radii}, there is a relatively clean and narrow
relationship between radius and \Teff{} on the main sequence. We used the 
DSEP-derived radius for each individual object to transform  between
velocity and period coordinates. The fraction of objects with period
short enough to produce detectable \vsini{} is shown as the dashed 
lines in \cref{fig:detection_fraction}. The photometric rapid rotator fraction
ranges from 5-8\% for photometric binaries at 0.5-1\% for single stars.


Due to the \(\sin i\) ambiguity, there isn't a direct correlation
between a \vsini{} cut and the corresponding period cut given a stellar radius.
Many rapid rotators in period-space scatter into being non-detections in
velocity space after convolution with the inclination distribution. However,
this distribution can be statistically characterized for randomly
aligned systems showing photometric variability. Studies of spots in young open
clusters indicate that spots only produce variability when \(\sin i < 1/2\). 
Since our underlying sample was chosen based on
\Teff{} and \logg{}, we only expect a strong bias in inclination caused by spot
geometry.
Therefore, we perform a statistical correction of \(\sqrt{3}/8+\pi/6=0.740\)
to account for photometric rapid rotators scattering to low
\vsini{}. Applying this correction exacerbates the disagreement between
spectroscopic and photometric rapid rotator rates because the inferred range of
rapid rotators increases to 35-67\% for binaries.

This result shows that the fraction of
spectroscopic rapid rotators is significantly larger than the fraction
of spectroscopic rapid rotators by a factor of 4-13. Accounting for
inclination effects makes the discrepancy even worse to a 4-\(\sigma\)
level. This discrepenacy is highly robust to the choice of
\vsini{} detection limit. Unlike  
the case with the asteroseismic targets, the fraction of spectroscopic rapid
rotators is greater than the fraction of photometric rapid
rotators at a highly-significant level, which is exacerbated afer taking the
inclination correction into account.

We validated this exercise by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic
rapid rotator fractions in the asteroseismic sample. In order to have the best
overlap sample, we used \vsini{} from \citet{Bruntt12} and rotation periods
from \citet{Garcia14}, whose sample for studying stellar rotation specifically
targeted asteroseismic dwarfs and subgiants. In the asteroseismic
sample, we found the expected result that the rapid rotator
fraction as measured spectroscopically and photometrically agreed to within
1-\(\sigma\) at all \vsini{} thresholds. Therefore, we believe this
discrepancy of rotation measures in the cool dwarfs is real.

We also checked the spectroscopic rapid rotator fraction of the 
\citet{McQuillan14} nondetections for the single and binary sequences. We 
found that the spectroscopic rapid rotator fraction is significantly
lower in the nondetections than the overlap sample for the binaries, but are 
inconsistent with zero for both the binary and single stars. 
A non-zero rapid rotator fraction is surprising because the nondetection
sample is expected to be comprised of slow-rotating inactive stars and 
high-inclination spotted stars, both of which are incompatible with low 
\vsini{} values. 

Previous studies have found an inverse correlation between 
photometric variability and Rossby number (defined as \(R_o = P / \tau_{cz}\), where \(P\)
    is the rotation period and \(\tau_{cz}\) is the color-dependent 
convective overturn timescale) \citep{Messina01,Hartman09}. The existence of 
stars with low Rossby number and low photometric variability may either 
indicate that additional factors determine photometric variability 
aside from the Rossby number, or that \citet{McQuillan14} is not detecting 
rapid rotation in genuine, spotted rapid rotators.

\end{figure*}

After selecting dwarfs with detectable rotation in APOGEE,
visually inspecting for DLSBs, and cross-matching with \citet{McQuillan14}, we 
ended up with 22 confident and 20 \vsini{} detections on the photometric binary
sequence, and 2 confident and 5 marginal \vsini{} measurements on the dwarf
sequence, where we can individually compare \vsini{} and rotation period. A 
point-by-point
comparison for these targets is shown in the bottom panels of
\cref{fig:rot}. The comparison between \vsini{} and equatorial velocity shows
that the discrepancy found in Section~\ref{sec:fraction} is not due to slight
but coherent model errors, or a few discrepant points. Unlike with the
asteroseismic sample in Section~\ref{sec:astero}, all but one of the targets
lie in the forbidden \(\sin i > 1\) region with both the confident and
marginal detections affected. This is indicative of a systematic
bias where periods are consistently (and sometimes drastically) too slow to be
consistent with \vsini{}.

The observation that this discrepancy exists for cool dwarfs and not
asteroseismic stars is also a significant clue. It indicates that the
discrepancy is only apparent for certain parts of the HR diagram. The main
differences between the two are the temperatures, with asteroseismic targets
being significantly warmer than our cool sample, and evolutionary state, where
asteroseismic targets are subgiants and the cool sample consists of dwarfs.

The discrepancy between spectroscopic and 
photometric rapid rotation fractions can be seen in other published work as well. 
\citet{Nielsen13} compared their measurements of \Kepler{} rotation periods to
an amalgamation of \vsini{} from various clusters. They found that the
\vsini{} distribution was consistent with the period distribution for spectral
types F--K, and then the periods dropped below the \vsini{} measurements for
K--M (top panel of their Fig. 2). They ascribe the discrepancy to the cool
stars as a shift in the \Kepler{} age distribution between the hot and cool
stars; however, they claim to reproduce rotational periods with previous work. 
Additional confirmation occured through the APOGEE M-dwarf rotation
program \citep{Gilhool18}, which surveyed a color- and proper-motion-selected 
sample of nearby M-dwarfs. Unlike in this work, the \vsini{} were measured 
directly through the spectra as opposed to through ASPCAP\@. For the \Teff{} range that
overlaps with \citet{McQuillan14} \(4000 \textrm{ K } > \Teff > 3200\) K, they 
find that 5.8\% of their targets have \(\vsini > 8 \kms\). This is 
significantly greater than our photometric rapid rotator fraction at 8 \kms{} 
of 2.5\%. 

While spectroscopic rapid rotation didn't necessarily imply photometric
rapid rotation, we find that photometric rapid rotation is generally
reflected in spectroscopy. This can be seen in the right panel of
\cref{fig:sample}, where 7/8 of the targets with \(P_{rot} < 3\) day
have detectable spectroscopic rapid rotation. This suggests two
possibilities: the \citet{McQuillan14} method misclassifies rapid
rotators as slow, or that the APOGEE \vsini{} have significant false
positives.

Confusion in the \Kepler{} pixels is also a potential explanation for the
discrepancy. Because the \Kepler{} pixels are relatively large (4\arcsec), a 
bright, hot primary sharing a pixel with a fainter, spottier companion 
contributing the photometric modulation in the
\Kepler{} light curve would explain the observed contradiction between
\vsini{} and rotation period. Despite this setup being unlikely, because for 
stars cooler than the Kraft break, rotation and activity are highly 
correlated, we check for bright companions
within the \Kepler{} pixel using the \Kepler{} field high-resolution UKIRT
J-band images introduced in Section~\ref{sec:astero}. We did not find a 
correlation between that the presence of a bright companion and the magnitude 
of the offset, indicating that confusion is likely not the main source of the 
problem.

One other potential explanation for the mismatch between the photometric
rotation periods and \vsini{} is the presence of SB2s with a special geometry
where the two components are offset enough that their spectral features
overlap, yet not offset enough for the two components to be visually
distinguished. Binarity would also explain the difference in behaviors
between the cool dwarfs and asteroseismic targets; stars with close, but
not identical masses would have similar luminosities on the main
sequence, but significantly different luminosities when the primary
becomes a subgiant, reducing the impact of the secondary on
\vsini{}. To determine the likelihood of this scenario, we check whether
these targets show signs of composite spectra \citep{ElBadry18}. They
report that 18/19 rapid rotators on the photometric sequence and 2/2 on the
main sequence show signs of composite spectra based on their
data-driven classification. While \citet{ElBadry18} successfully inferred the
high binary fraction of our sample, the fact that they classified both objects
with low photometric excesses as having composite spectra suggests that 
rapid rotation may be degenerately classifie with a composite spectrum
in the machine-learning method of \citet{ElBadry18}.

The explanation we put forward for the behavior of rapid rotation is that the
rapid rotators in the \Kepler{} field are binaries in close enough orbits that
the tidal coupling timescale between their orbital and spin angular momenta are
short compared to their ages. The fact that these close, rapidly-rotating are
overwhelmingly found in photometric binaries is supported by theoretic
simulations \citep{Bate02}. 

The discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic rapid rotator rate is
likely due to a combination of factors affecting both the photometric and
spectroscopic data. As previously discussed, contamination from blended spectra
is one source of the discrepancy. Another is that the periodograms used in 
large-scale analyses are confused by systems with multiple active components.
Beating and dilution of the rotation signals may cause surious long-term
periods to be detected. Higher-resolution spectroscopy than achieved by APOGEE
would be able to distinguish between the two scenarios by determining whether
the broad lines of the rapid rotators are intrinsically broad, or resolve into
separate components.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We analyzed the APOGEE sample of 368 cool dwarfs in the \Kepler{} field with 
rotation periods in \citet{McQuillan14} using DSEP-derived stellar radii. One
of the first results we found was that 86\% of the rapid rotators are
photometric binaries, indicating that rapid rotation is largely the product of
binary evolution. For the binaries in particular, we
found a substantial discrepancy between the two measures of rotation
among the high \vsini{} targets, with the spectroscopic rapid
rotator rate being 4--13 times the photometric rapid rotator rate. 

A point-by-point analysis of the 49 rapid rotators in our sample revealed that
rotational periods for the entire sample are universally too long to match the 
\vsini{}. This finding implies severe systematic uncertainties in either the
measurement of \vsini{} or rotation period. We suggest several possible ways 
to investigate the underlying causes.

The best way to determine how much of the discrepancy is due to blending of
spectral line is to follow-up with high-resolution spectroscopy beyond the
resolution of APOGEE\@. Whether or not the broadening is found to be real, or to
be composed of multiple components will help determine the true rapid
rotator rate in the \Kepler{} field.

Systematic uncertainties in period determinations will be significantly more
difficult to investigate. One start may be to perform a targeted period search
at short periods for the rapid rotators where the blind search returned a long
period. The presence of a short-period signal would confirm that the
spectroscopic rapid rotators are physical. Another direction would be to use an
algorithm which can successfully identify multiple periods, as has been used
for the K2 cluster campaign \citep{Rebull16,Rebull17}. If multiple signals are
present in a light curve, these methods may be able to pick both as opposed to
favoring one over the other.

Regardless of the source of the inconsistency, we caution readers about 
interpreting large datasets of rotation in the \Kepler{} field without 
independent confirmation until the source of this inconsistency is found.
